Text: Hello. I (23F) have tried to make a post to explain what's going on with me, but I just end up crying, and everything I write is incoherent, so. Sorry if there's not enough context?

I'm having a really difficult time right now. I can't really focus on work, and I don't get in as many hours as I should. I feel like I am letting people down. 

Existing is exhausting, and all I can do is waste time on my phone, because if I'm on my phone I don't have to think and time passes more quickly. 
I'm tired of spending hours on my phone instead of doing functional-people things, I'm just putting everything off and setting myself up for failure. But doing anything productive feels too daunting, and I don't know how to start? 

I want to develop healthy habits - spend less time on my phone, maybe go outside more often, go on walks, stick to my work schedule, find hobbies. Simple things that I know would improve my mental health.
But even though I want those things, I feel like I'm not motivated enough to make a change. It's always easier to stay in my comfort zone, to distract myself. My brain says I need to change, but I feel like I don't want it bad enough to actually try. 

I can't keep living like this, though. 

I've tried looking for advice online, but everything I see involves:
- Therapy, which I don't have money for. 
- Reaching out, but I have very few people I'm close with, and I don't feel comfortable talking about my mental health to any of them. 
- Self-help books and stuff, which just...does not work on me.
- Hobbies, but I don't really have any of those anymore? I've been depressed for so long, I've lost interest in the ones I used to have as a kid, and never developed new ones. 

So I guess I'm wondering/hoping you all might have some advice on how to get a bit better, something that doesn't involve the things I just mentioned ? 

I don't know. I wish wanting to get better was enough to spur me into action. Sorry if what I'm asking for doesn't exist, or if I wasn't very clear.
Thanks for reading

Text: Hello,

Today my girlfriend decided we will no longer be together. Or I don't even know how to put it. Throughout our relationship I believe my anxiety made me insecure and at times it got to the point where I would tell her that I don't think I want to be in a relationship with her. To me they were always empty words in what I'm now thinking was a cry out for help but seeing it through her eyes, why wouldn't she believe me, and why wouldn't this effect her. It would have a terrible effect on me. And about a week ago I said it again, and that was the last straw for her.

So here I am, alone. I've never really had many friends and never reached out to make some because she was my best friend. I've battled anxiety and depression for a while now but don't know how to cope with what has happened. While I have talked to a psychologist before this girl was the only one who I truly felt free speaking with and has helped me tremendously through the years.

My anxiety has a bad effect on my body and I'm so scared I'm going to throw away my new job that I love, and the great opportunities I have because I just can't bother to get up and go out the door.

I don't know what to do.  I just want the girl I've loved for so long.

Text: Not really sure where to even start with this one...

I just find that the only reason I'm alive is simply because of my biological programming.  I haven't found any purpose to want to live, but the fundamental instinct to live is what's keeping me going.

I have isolated myself from pretty much everyone and I have no meaningful emotional connections with people.  I have never been emotionally or physically intimate with anyone and at this point I feel as though this is just the cards I've been dealt, that the idea of having a meaningful connection with another person is almost too unrealistic to expect.  I feel as though I've wasted my time on this planet spending it alone, but then I find myself equally unhappy when I am around people.  It seems like I'm incapable of enjoying my own company or the company of others.  I want to change this but whenever I open myself up to other people, it comes with emotional stress that I just don't know how to internalize.  I know that if I continue down this road I am almost certainly committing myself to a life of isolating misery or suicide.  I just don't know how to live any differently.

And because this has been a theme for me so long, its become a part of my identity in a way to be depressed like this.  It feels as though any attempt to change this underlying cause would be a betrayal to my true self or something.

I want to change things, I don't want to commit myself to a life of isolation and apathy.  I would like to have genuine and meaningful connections with people and feel like I have some sort of meaning in being alive..  But I just find that nothing makes me want to wake up the next morning.  There is no underlying passion for life, just the motions.  

I have been to more therapists and psychiatrists than I can count on my hands, I just don't know what to do anymore.

Apologize for the rant, this all just hitting me hard as of late.

Text: Me and my boyfriend have a really good relationship most of the time.  We want the same things and are usually very in sync, until we have a minor disagreement.  To me they are mainly about trivial things like chores, but they always escalate because of how we both act.  I get frustrated and either get angry and shout or really upset and cry.  He just leaves, actually packs up his bags and leaves home.
This happened again yesterday and he left.  He came to pack his stuff today and after begging him he eventually opened up to me.  He said he feels like a shadow of himself with work, friends, family and that he feels so much better away from me.  He said some nasty things yesterday but this was really what he thought, and it really hurt me.  I’ve been doing some research and think he is depressed, I managed to get him to agree to get help today and said i would give him space for a couple of weeks while he’s basically said he’s seeing if he’s better without me.  I can barely breathe without him, and while I am so upset that he has treat me this way I just want him to come back to me.  
What happens if he realises he doesnt need me?  i have no appetite or enthusiasm for anything and dont know how i’m going to function enough to go to work, let alone make it through the next 2 weeks, or longer, alone

Text: So much pain. So much suffering. So much loss, for so many varied, completely unnecessary reasons. How am I supposed to enjoy a cup of coffee? When I know the suffering “we” have endured. I can’t take myself seriously because I feel the pain, for what very very very little that is worth. How am I supposed to believe that I, me, tiny inconsequential me, is supposed to want to live amongst all of this pain and loss. How am I supposed to live knowing that I’m breathing air that could be used by someone else who needs it more than me.

Text: Hey all ! I am new to the group and  a Canadian I would like some advice. This is a VERY long post so bare with me. 

 I took on basically taking care of my severely  depressed younger brother. I am 26 and my brother is 20.  I have been moved out for 4 years, my brother has been under child protective services from the overly toxic environment at home. 

 For some background mom is an addict ( alcoholic ) and dad definitely has mental illness and severe emotional disregulation and is severely controlling and overall unhealthy and manipulative  ( violent outbursts , tantrums, controlling ).they are both functional for the most part but very terrible to be around and our entire family became severely dysfunctional as a result and has suffered a lot.  

 In the past I have had reactive depression but am better now here is what I experienced ;  

Basically I can get depressed when sad events happen like breakup/ death or I would  experience severe anxiety when I lived with my parents ( to say the least )  .

I got depressed and severely melancholic ( experience debiliating guilt ans self-hatred )  and could not function well for months/ years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. 

My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example.  He also is a high-school drop-out (2x) because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his self-esteem. He is very smart ( beat a Canadian chess champion at chess ) but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information ( poor memory, brain fog ) . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to self-punish himself for dropping out of highschool ( he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  "  loser ".. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues ). 

I have been pestering my brother to move out of my parents for the longest time. He finally did last week  and came to live with me. I congratulated him for taking the right steps.I told him he always has a place with me. And this is why I still took him in despite having reservations as I am not exactly where I want to be in my life financially  either but I am doing better than him and better than before so I felt like it's worth a shot ( and still do ) . He has never worked a single job because of his mental illness and because of my parents hostility.

This past year I have focused a lot on healing from my own health issues: had two surgeries and heart issues but I feel better than ever before and also getting over a breakup which is hard for someone like.me who tends to get reactive depression as a result of difficult life events . 

I'm doing well at work, was recruited by my manager to follow into her foot septs and applied to a program  at McGill university that my employer would pay for the purpose of developping my career at the hospital I work for. I work in admin and might work in management following this management succession program ( if they accept me because even though I was recruited still waiting for acceptance letter ).

But it took me a long while  to get to a place where I can be stable enough (mentally) to get back on track or at least try too. I have anxiety too ( was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ) but I feel like it's been under control the last few monrhs. Moreover , I have my own fears of failure as I've had a difficult experience with school in the past even though I graduated highschool and college .. 

My brother is the sweetest person. He is 20, however  never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years,  my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasn't left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years.  And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and  now he is finally with me.

I want to be the best support but I haven't stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships ( don't have many left haha but 2-3)  but also worried for him too as he won't eat unless I tell him to, won't move his body unless I  tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family.  I don't want to turn into my mom where I cook and clean all the time ( she is a functioning alcoholic but gets highly abusive when she drinks but still cooked and cleaned ) even though I cooked for.myself growing up as I'm vegan and she didn't want to cook vegan food for me when I turned 19. 

I want my brother to feel confident but he doesn't because he dropped out of highschool twice as a result of mental illness growing up. Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation ( can't get our of bed ) and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved .

I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday ( tomorrow )  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program  to recommend to the doctor for my brother.They do a more intensive follow-up for mental health adults that lasts 2 years and they work at the patient 's pace... My fear is he will give up or not accept the help even though he told me he is open to it last Sunday. Yesterday he started getting hesitant again saying he didn't want to do the work but also he is aware he needs to get better..

What my concerns are ; 
1.Basically I know that I have what it takes to help him and objectively he is better off with me that he is with my parents and since he has nowhere else to go I won't let him starve or end up on the steet. But, I want to know how to get past my  own emotions and fears and anxieties regarding this entire situation and NOT identify with his depression. 

2. I want to set healthy boundaries also where I don't get caught up in saving him because I already feel like I'm trying to do that... but I don't know what that would look like... should I give him a contract or make him sign a "promise to himself " what do I do if after a year he has not progressed ? Should there be "consequences " not punishments but, a different recommendation ? I don't want to end up taking care of.him forever I want him to heal with me and get back on his feet. 

3.Moreover,  I don't want his depression to trigger me and I don't want his negativity ( not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything ) to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset ( I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family ) ... It worries me because everything he says is a cognitive distortion and in life, as we know, you become the people you hang out with the most..
4 . I want him.to become more resilient, I am not expecting a cure but I want him to be processing in the right direction not the other way around.

5.  I also respect that he has a serious disease that needs medical attention and specialized / tailored follow-ups.  I want to be a good example to him...  one that is different from my parents.. He has become like them . Negative about everything on top of having severe psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite ( hence why I am am getting him to the doctor tomorrow ). 

6. He has been on antidepressants before but it wasn't good. He had more appetite but still didn't leave his room. Meds are not unknown to him. I believe tomorrow the doctors help will give us the best choices for him.

7. He is aware he is sick and even agrees he needs meds, we.watched a 50 min video by Dr. Sapolsky yesterday regarding how depression affects the brain and he realized just how affective depression is to the hypocampus etc... My brother knows he has congirive distortions most of the time. How do I keep him motivated to stay on track and improve slowly slowly day by day ? 

I guess in conclusion my biggest fear is that taking care of him gets me sick too ( I think it's a valid fear considering I am mentally fragile ans afraid of ending up depressed too )

DISCLAIMER: I don't want comments telling me he should be helped by someone else. He had nobody else and it is my pleasure to help him and be there for him forever. I just have legitimate concerns that I believe your tips and advice could help me navigate the situation better.

Any tips ?? 

Thank you so much,
Christina.

TLDR: come from an abusive home, made it out, somewhat okay trying to get my life back on track ans have been on track for a while so to speak but need advice helping me brother after he moved out of our abusive home, he has severe depression and psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite. I booked him an appointment with doctor for tomorrow but I need ripe on how to take on this responsibility without letting his negativity ( not shaming him as this is a symptom of his depression ) get to me and make me depressed too. How do I do this and maintains good mental health hygiene. How do I set boundaries ? Also.please read full text as my TLDR is not ever going to be short enough to fully encapsulate everything I wrote down.

Text: Currently recovering from anxiety and extreme amounts of stress. I feel slightly irritated all the time.  When I am listening to nonsense podcasts(jokes, random nonsense, wrestling) then I feel ok. When I try to listen to an audiobook or a podcast where I have to pay attention I get very irritated and tired. I also feel stressed. Yesterday this irritation got so bad that I felt it was hard to contain it. It feels like pain and burning in my head. 

I am currently not working due to sick leaves. I will be seeing my psychologist tomorrow. Any suggestions? Any food or activity that would help me?

Text: So I'm not suicidal (thank god) and I know I've posted many times here I just need advice (duh 🤪). So in short I went through Priapism pretty badly last year and I was wondering if you could call the surgery to fix it (I had it looked at twice) would be classified as trauma. I have dreams about being in the 2 ERs and the ambulance ride. I think about what I have lost and the surgery all the damn time. I feel like it was and still is. Idk I just want to know if I'm wrong or not. Thanks in advance!

Text: My fiancee is a student nurse after a career change and is currently in her second year. She had setbacks due to COVID and a broken wrist (which still requires a re-set operation that she is putting off because of training). Her last placement was absolute hell and she had deliberately obstructive staff rather than anyone who would sign off her competencies. She has a history of severe depression and is taking medication, but has really gone downhill for the last month or longer. On the worst days she is barely able to take care of herself and of course it puts our relationship under terrible strain, but I try to help and support where ever I can.

She feels trapped in this career path, and has admitted that she is continuing because she feels she has no other options, but I am genuinely afraid that it is killing her. She really wanted to be a community nurse and the ward shifts are taking a serious toll on her mental and physical health. I've tried to talk about finding other options or just ways to cope with the stress, but she's not really interested at this point. I'm terrified for her and the shifts start again in a couple of weeks.

I know lots of us have depression (me included) at times and have just about any career, but I am out of ideas and looking for any advice from healthcare professionals. Is this the wrong path for her?

Text: Since I've hit my 20's, my depression has just plummeted. In high school, I hadn't been diagnosed yet with my anxiety and depression, and even though it was present it didn't feel nearly as bad as this. I hit my 20's, now 23 yrs old, and I am having constant depression cycles. The cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. As of lately I have been probably the most down that I have felt to date. I am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. I haven't been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I don't have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I don't know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fiancé and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also can't lose any money from it. I do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but I just need a break now. I am lost. Any advice would be so helpful.

Text: I honestly feel like I should die and I'm a mistake, before you suggest it, I told my mom. She tried to be  supportive but I feel no better, it's gone on for long. Since I was 5-7. I'm honestly sick of faking being happy, I don't know what more to do.

# Why I wouldn't kill myself

I'm afraid of death, and even if I wasn't, there's nothing I could use. I'm probably ''too young'' anyways, that's probably why my mom shrugged it off. 

# Why I want to kill myself

First off, I have trouble getting to sleep, I hardly wake up in the night, it's just hard for me to get asleep. My mom has taken notice of that too. ''Over tired'' she calls it. Also, I'm super lonely, I have no friends, the only place I have friends is on the internet, but they're not on much, and when they are, I'M the one giving support. I get they have problems too, but I gave up so long ago. I'm also so scared of so many things. Falling into the sky, on a wall/the ceiling, that is a big problem for me when I look up in the sky or look up when I'm lying down. It just scares me, it doesn't affect my sleeping, but other ascepts. Failure. Nobody likes failure right? It's worse for me. I'm scared of failure because I feel if I fail then; nobody would like me, they would ignore me more, I would be more alone. I know it's not true, I just can't escape that fear.

Sorry if this is too long, I've just been holding this in so long.

Text: Life's not going good for me and I'm realizing now that I may have been in a deep depression and not even realized it. I've been depressed before and realized it but this seems different. I've had good days and bad days but everyday it seems like I always drop to a deep low everyday. Idk if I'm depressed or just over thinking it.

I can't get myself to be happy. I'll find little moments of joy and some days I'm in a really good mood but then always seem to drop down. Like I'll be having a good day and then it feels like the floor crumbled under me and now I'm so low that I can't see light. I just don't feel good.

 I've put up these many walls to keep emotions and feelings away because of my new job, home responsibilities and marriage responsibilities. I've pent up so much that I can't even seem to cry. I've tried but after like  minute it just shuts off. Like I can't get myself to cry.

I'm at a lose and don't know what to do. I keep telling myself things will turn out OK but I just want to stop existing.  Like I don't necessarily want to die but I also don't want to live. And this has been a consistent for months. I feel like I've been in a deep depression and I can't seem to pull myself out. But again idk.

How do I tell when I am and how do I pull myself out?

Can anyone please help?...

Text: I F(15) have always been a super academic student athlete, getting high 80s and 90s throughout middle school and into about halfway through ninth grade, when the depression started to kick in. it wasn’t as bad as it is now, but my grades started to get significantly lower.

This school year (tenth grade) my academics are horrendous. I have failed math in 2/3 terms (51 first term, dropped into 40s for 2nd term) and my science grade was in the mid 60s for term 1 and i think i failed term 2. 

I have no motivation to bring myself to do anything anymore. I can barely leave my bed. I am a competitive dancer and have always been super passionate and serious about it, and now i just don’t care any anymore. 

My dad who has been apart of my whole life (but not really at the same time because he’s a drunk a*sh*le) is in critical condition and is dying. I don’t know if it’s because of the emotional trauma and physical abuse he has caused me throughout the years, but i also feel numb to him dying. i feel like i won’t even give a shit when he’s gone and i know that sounds absolutely awful but i seriously don’t feel anything 

I honestly have no idea how to deal with this right now, because my mom doesn’t really believe i’m depressed and won’t take me to a therapist. I know 10th grade is the most important year for math and science academics where i live and i honestly feel like it’s too late to fix anything. now i can’t help but think i’m going to flunk out of high school and end up working at a gas station for the rest of my life 

someone please give me some sort of direction or guidance on what i could possibly do because i feel really lost and confused right now, and i’m terrified about my future with my poor academics right now 

[edit: sorry if there’s a bunch of grammatical errors, it’s late at night and i didn’t feel like proof reading this before i posted it.]

Text: A lot of people have called me a weirdo and I know why. 
I laugh really loudly (it's super obnoxious and I think I do it because I'm an attention seeker and it make it seem like what my friend and I are talking about a lot funnier that it actually is because I want people to think I'm funny). I also laugh at jokes even if they're not funny (because it's less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say)
I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents (again, it might be because I want people to think I'm funny)
I don't think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldn't say something. It's like my brain's delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me (I think my brain's on autopilot all the time and I don't think)
I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them (which is just weird, it's also creepy) 
Sometimes when I speak super fast, I end up speaking gibberish and no one knows what I'm saying (again, it might be because I don't think before I speak)
I make weird, sharp movements (because I'm thinking out loud and I forget that I'm not alone)
I make weird sounds in general (I don't know if it's because I'm so bored and I need to keep myself busy or if I'm a psychopath)
I fidget a lot and I can't keep my hands to myself 
I don't know if it's because I feel so out of place or if it's because I feel so uncomfortable all the time and that's why I do all of these things. I just feel so strange and I agree with people when they call me a weirdo (even though I hate to admit it)
I feel so on edge all the time and I don't know how to calm myself down. I'm so hyper all the time. But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like I'm boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo (it's a never ending cycle)
I'm constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like I'm talking to myself (which is super embarrassing). Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but it's super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality (I'm a lot better now and I don't daydream as much)
I constantly feel like I'm under so much pressure 
I'm not feminine in any way. I don't care of my appearance and I smell (but I just don't feel like taking care of myself, I know it's a crappy excuse). I feel so masculine and I hate it. I love being a girl, but I don't know why I can't bring myself to act like one. I sit like a man too. 
As weird as it sounds, I feel like I'm watching myself play a character. Almost as if I'm not allowing myself to be my true self because I think I'm boring. I don't know why I can't allow myself to slow down. 
I'm always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. I'm so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I don't know what to do about this. 
I don't know if it's because my family have always called me insane and as an act of rebellion, maybe I'm acting like that because I believe it too. 
I don't think I'm insane but, maybe I'm wrong?
It's driving people away and it's driving me insane. 
I'm not aware of my surroundings and it really pisses people off, including myself. 
I really need some advice and I want to know why I'm acting like this and what I need to do to be a better person.

Text: I got fired yesterday, got into a car accident last Monday. 

I have no car. I have 10 pounds to my name until the first of August.

I'm so fucked. Every time I open up to people, it doesn't seem like they care. My girlfriend doesn't seem to care and she's starting to get really mad at me for talking about my feelings so much.

I feel really, really alone. I live by myself and I have like two friends.

I don't know what to do, I really don't. 

My life just seems like shit. All year it has been shit. I really want to give up. I really fucking want to give up.

Text: I’m tired of everyone hating me and treating me badly. I didn’t do anything bad to make everyone hate me. No one wants me. No one has ever wanted to be my friend irl, no one wants to be my girlfriend, no one wants to have anything to do with me. Everyone just leaves me, even when they say they wont. The best “friend” I ever had left me almost 2 months ago. Everyone just leaves, rejects, and makes fun of me. I don’t get why. There’s just no point in me living.

Text: (Sorry is this is the wrong place to post)

I’m having a really rough week. I can’t stop crying. Life has hit me repeatedly over the last six months, but this week has left me completely broken. 

My dad died 6 months ago and my mother isn’t dealing with it in a healthy way. Everyday she calls crying and sends messages in the middle of the night about her sadness. It’s really dragging me down. 

On top of that my sister has cancer. Tonight I got a call that she was rushed to the hospital and they are doing tests right now. 

And my boyfriend of over a year just left me saying he isn’t happy in the relationship. 

I don’t know what to do, I need help. I was already struggling from depression and anxiety before any of this happened.

Text: I'm 19, super bad social anxiety to the point where I can't even go down to the corner store anymore. I'm constantly in fear of being judged due to my gynamastia or whatever tf it's called. I had a couple friends in highschool but when I dropped out I started getting more depressed to the point where I didn't want anyone around me in fear of me making them sad. I can't talk to people, I just shut down when someone says anything to me and people now think I'm a weirdo who doesn't talk. So even if I wanted to open up they'd just think I'm more weird right? I just want a friend... Or to not have to kill myself cause at this point it seems the only plausible option.

Still done nothing, i haven’t left my room since the start of the month. I have no friends And I’m 17 it’s going to be impossible soon. I thought since this was pride month things could’ve been different but its not. I’m planning on taking my life soon i’m miserable every day and what happens when I’m and adult and I have to get a minimum wage job, I barely even wanna wake up now when I do nothing all day and I don’t know if my anxiety could let me have a job and if I don’t then I don’t wanna be a adult-child. Death just seems like a perfect out to all my (many) mental problems. Sure I’ll never become a woman or find someone to love but I won’t even know... because I’ll be dead :/

Text: I probably should just drop the ball on my friend but I wanna try to reach out. I typically have deeper talks w her and she leaves me on read, she's kind of ignoring me when I ask mundane things too.

even the funny memes (maybe she doesn't find it funny) are seen but not replied to. not sure what to say or do, and I know times are dull for everyone but I just want my friend to message me back, even if it's a "leave me alone, pocket".

Text: My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide (to the best of my knowledge) twice before. She has never kept up with therapy (of any sort) as she doesn’t believe it works.
Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours - really just your average symptoms of depression.

In recent times (over the last 6 months) her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again:    
•She doesn’t socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years (daily gym and a monthly book club) and refuses to do anything ‘new’ (due to the cost).   
•She hates her job and her co-workers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself ‘too old’ to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as ‘they wouldn’t notice me if i was there anyway’. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldn’t miss a day ever!    
•She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesn’t like that they make her gain weight (~5kgs) OR shes feels that they have ‘done their job’ and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she won’t even consider making an appointment to get a script.    
•She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.    
•Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears (mostly when she is drunk) to ‘just talk’ and keeping us on the phone for literally hours (her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm) until she feels ‘better’ or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 7-10 days.     
•Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers (my grandma, 88f) increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that ‘people’ think she is trying to kill Grandma (which is completely unfounded). She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandma’s care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade - a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour.    
•She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the  the last ~2years. Currently she consuming 1-2 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker.    
•Frequently making statements such as  ‘just wanting to die’, ‘I should just die’, ‘someone should just shoot me’, ‘i’ll just die’. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day.
There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most.

For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her (and have done so for years) as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors  in her life recently.    
•Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time.    
•Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. -Grandma’s health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isn’t dealing with Grandma’s care anymore she is still stressed about it.    
•She believes she is getting bullied at work (claims to be getting ‘cold-shouldered’ and that people are hiding her belongings). She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word (which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state).

I have tried to help her by:    
•Convincing her to begin antidepressants again (which she is refusing to do, she will ‘get fat again’).    
•To at least see a therapist (she is refusing to as it ‘doesn’t work’, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been ‘fighting’ with -see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused). I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible (saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house).    
•Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together (she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a ‘why bother’ mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she ‘doesn’t feel like it’).   
•Actively making plans with her (which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand). I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns (which they have shared) and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together (which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact) but she still has not been engaging.    
•Taking all her calls and trying to (gently) help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls (I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something).    
•Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try (as she claims she can not afford them). Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like (she took this offer as an insult that she needed ‘supervision’).    
•Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications.

Last night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night (from 5 hours away) because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldn’t complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed (the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away). I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different. Both my sister and I am at our wits end and have no idea what else we can be doing or where to turn to. 

What more can we be doing?

TLDR: My Mum is depressed and highly likely to be suicidal. I’ve run out of ways to help, what can I do?

However I dont want to give off the impression that I think that the lockdowns are useless i understand that they work.
Also im 13 m so i dont know if that has anything to do with it.
Any help appreciated.

Text: Does anyone have any advice for dealing with/managing depression that's either caused by or exacerbated by their job?   


My job closed back at the start of the pandemic. I was off work for almost a year and a half. Things were actually starting to look up the last few weeks/months. I was slowly becoming productive again. Getting closer ot feeling normal. I was actually making progress on my portfolio and studying, to get a job that I don't hate.

But my job opened up again last week. It's been 3 days. And already, it feels as though I've spiralled all the way back down to exactly where I was before. It feels as though this horrible dark cloud is hanging over me again.

I feel permantently exhausted. Too tired and on edge to get on with anything. Everything just feels like this big, anxious bad dream, slowly counting down to when I'm next working. I just feel a constant dread, waiting for the next shift.

I hate my job. I hate the people I work with. I hate my customers.

I don't know how to stop feeling like this. But I *need* to if I ever want to get out of this job. I need to be focused. I need to be able to focus on getting this portfolio done. I need to focus on picking up these qualifications that I need. I need to be able to focus on studying. I'd almost got it down during the pandemic. Now I'm back to exactly where I started.

Text: I have had depression since I was 15 , started treatment at 18. Now I'm 21 and I know my mom's tired . She doesn't know what to do anymore and neither do I.
I feel like I'm a burden. That I'm taking space of someone else. I feel like I should just fucking die and leave everyone alone.
I want to talk to my ex because I want to feel the way he loved me again. But I know he hates me too, or doesn't even think about me anyway.
I want someone to just hug me and let me cry in their arms. But I know I fucked things up and nobody can't stand me now.
I don't fit in. I have no friends , no one I can't talk about this .

Text: Hi everyone. First time posting here and looking to see if anyone has any advice. This is not a throw away because I don’t care what people think about me. 

I suffer from highly functional depression. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and am currently on medication, which helps, but still have bad days. I have seen a psychologist in the past, middle aged male, that I couldn’t open up to. After seeing him for 2 years I stopped going because of work change. My spouse, primary care, and psychiatrist all urge me to find someone to talk to. I thought long and hard and realized the personality of someone that I could open up to.

With all this being said, is there a good way to search for local therapists online in your area? I tried a few months back and could only find older individuals. I need someone closer to my age (36) as I feel it would allow me to open up more.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Text: Hi, i have some mental and physical problems which make me dream of ending my life. 
I have very strong kinds of weakness/lack of energy/always tired/pain what effects my body. 
That is the reason why i get upset and can't believe it will get better because i got it maybe bout 3 years. 
This physical struggles are killing me and on the other hand depression kicks in. 
Special kind of thoughts, suicidal fantasy, how i act, how i interact with people, most of the time it feels like I'm not in reality. 

I wish there whould be a way to escape this problems, but it doesn't seem so.
It's since puberty with the depression, and got even worse with all the physical symptoms. 
Now I'm lying most of the day in bed with pain/weakness and when i feel bit better i try to do something.

Is someone out there who had this struggles? 
Or are here people with similar problems and know how to handle it. 
It's really a strong limitation for the life and it makes it worthless.

I'm constantly trying to understand what's wrong with her and what's making her do despicable things to me, but I really can't take it, the things she did (and does) to me, and the way she got away with ruining my life, and the way she turned my grandfather against me and making me the bad guy.

I doubt if she ever saw me as a daughter for once, and not just a mere trophy to boast about. She does not care a crap about my need for privacy, she peeks into my phone, my books, my laptop, and what not, every chance she gets. She constantly hurls curses at me even if something goes minutely wrong or her needs and wants aren't satisfied the way she wanted them to be. She has literally told me in the past that she wished my life was ruined by someone, and I get raped by a vile person who would cheat me. Apart from that, I receive other constant curses like, "you won't live a good life at all, your life will be terrible, you'll burn in hell, your future will be terrible, and your husband will be a bad man" (okay, first of all, I'm TERRIFIED of relationships, marriage, or anything that has to do with the romantic paradigm. I've even talked to her about this but she can't help but obsess over me getting married, instead of me having a stable career. What's worse? She has no logical reasoning behind this obsession, and tries to sell me to the same institution {marriage} that ruined her and continues to ruin many others!) She yells at me for trivial things, and absolutely despises it when I even look at a person from the opposite sex - heck, she doesn't want me to even talk to MY OWN FATHER! She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver two-hour lectures about how she knows what's best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head - a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, family-oriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career (and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited). First of all, what a hypocritical thing to believe for a woman who'd been to several countries for work, and secondly, why wouldn't she try to put herself in my shoes FOR ONCE? 

She ruined my life by forcing me to join a terrible college, despite me getting accepted into better ones - she blackmailed me by playing a whole bunch of cards - my father's hard work card, my life will get ruined if I don't obey her card, I'm only doing good for you card, and what not - just so she could persuade my dad to buy a new apartment in some random suburb village area. Then came her tantrums to move into the suburb, despite owning a good enough home pretty much within the city. She had absolutely no logical reasons to move, and the only back-up she had were her delusions and the curses she hurled at me . Needless to say, she won again (all I asked from her was two years of time for me to move away from her and leave her to her much-wanted peace from me by graduating from college). She has bad blood and beef with almost all of her and dad's relatives, and the only backup she has is her father, who is a much more aggressive despot, who always thinks he's right, and others (esp who are younger and financially more unstable/dependent) do not have a right to question the decisions he imposed on their lives. My father is said to have been a compulsive liar in the past, and he seems to have reformed now, but he feels incredibly helpless in this situation, despite this suburb house being his property. This quarantine has made the situation pretty much worse, and I really want out, but I don't know whom to go to and seek help from. I've been a victim of constant gaslighting and emotional abuse (my mom believes other third party people more than she believes me, and exhibit A: this happened even when I was sexually harrassed by a driving school instructor, from a school SHE put me in). When I question my mother about her incredibly selfish and narcissistic ideals, and pushing me to be what she thinks is human perfection, she just shrugs it off by saying, "all humans are selfish, and this is human tendency, and hence my selfishness is justified". I don't know where to go, or what to do, and the worst part is, in the country where I live, you're legally an adult if you're 18, but you're not really an adult, for you don't get a job without graduating, and you definitely don't get affordable houses on rent with the meagre income you'd earn as a pink collared employee. Oh, and there's no "move out when you're 18" thing - people usually live with their parents here. 

Please help, what do I do?.

Text: Sorry I don't usually post so this might be kind of sloppy. for starters, I am not going to kill myself. I care too much about other peoples feelings. And my cats. But all my mind can think of is how nice it would be to be dead. I've been depressed like this one other time in my life, but this is the first time I have seriously considered self harm-I guess as a way to escape the internal pain? I haven't taken any steps to self harm but I have a strong urge to do so. I just want everything to end. I have no drive to do anything. I'm irritable as fuck. Nothing is going right and even if it was I probably wouldn't acknowledge it. Idk how to get out of this mindset-I have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. I've tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologist's but its super fucking hard in this mental state and there's a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc.... My question is whether or not this is still considered suicidal, even though I know I won't end my life, I would just like to. Anyone else experience this?

Text: I am so tired of being used. I wear a size 34G bra and so my boobs are big, like giant, and I'm not big or anything around my stomach so they're extremely noticable. but I try and hide them and I can't, I can't look nice or classy because when you have boobs like that everything looks slutty on you. But I've been trying to find a guy that cares about me as a person and I can't because every single guy that texts me is just in it for my boobs and it's breaking me down because I feel like if I don't get reduction and change how my body naturally is that I'm never going to find someone. I've struggled with a lot in my life, depression from my 2 mother leaving and bullying, anxiety from bullying, PTSD from some hard talk about things, and this added on just makes everything so much harder. I want to find love and I want to raise a family and be the mother that I never got but I feel like I'm never going to get that because nobody cares about who I am as a person. They care about my tits. I just want something real and I know it will never happen.

Text: This could turn out to be kinda long so I apologise in advance if anyone wants to read this.

Long story short: I‘m not sure if I‘m actually depressed or just imagining things.

So, this took quite a lot for me to post this and I will try my best to describe my situation. Some general information: I‘m 15M and have (like a lot of germans) been at home for home-schooling for almost a year know except for a few months where we went to school in person.

To be honest I don‘t really know when things started but I was talking to a friend of mine (video-chat) about a month ago and after he asked I explained to him how I was feeling. When I was done he said something along the lines of „Hmm that kind of sounds like some depression you got there.“ 

Now to what I told him: I think I stopped expressing how I feel at any given time at least a year ago and since covid took hold things have only gotten worse. I can‘t remember the last time I cried (tbh i felt like crying pretty often lately) or truly told anyone I wasn‘t doing too well. I always pretend I‘m happy and everything is normal so neither my parents nor my friends start worrying about me. One thing that really bothers me is that every time my friends who I 200% trust ask how I‘m doing I tell them „fine“. The conversation with my friend was an exception i guess. I want to explain it to them SO bad but somehow I keep stopping myself. 

A minor thing that might be worth mentioning is that I unfortunately remember practically every single mistake in my only relationship I ever had with a great girl I am not really over yet, friendships and in general ALL THE TIME. I always have to distract myself with something because every time I‘m left alone with my thoughts I go down the good old „Why did I do that?“ „Why would anyone do that?“ „Whats wrong with me?“ „Does he/she still remember that?“ road. School is almost insufferable because it leaves me a lot of time to think to myself and unfortunately it‘s rarely happy thoughts. 

The thing that makes all this so hard to decipher for me is that I‘m never certain how I feel. I know it sounds stupid but it‘s the best I can describe it. I have some good days where I just hang out with friends in discord and play minecraft all day but there‘s always that thought in the back of my mind that I don‘t deserve this. In contrast to that I also have bad days where I feel like I‘m on the edge of breaking down and giving up on everything. One of the most common feelings I have is hate towards myself.

Now the part that every „aRe yOU dePResSed? taKE THiS qUiz!“ website asks: Have I thought of suicide? More or less.

I‘ll be as honest as possible in this part. I have thought about if I would survive the distance from the window to the ground outside. I have thought about if it would hurt very much to stab myself. I was never actually anywhere close to doing it.

I have also thought about if I‘m important to my friends or if they‘re just with me out of pity. I have thought about if the world would be any different without me in it.

So, I have some suspicions that I COULD be depressed. But I also think its possible that i‘m just imagining things because I‘m just awful. 

If anyone made it through this, thank you for your time. If anyone wants to spend their time giving me advice i would be grateful.

-M

Text: I’m young and just don’t feel like doing anything. I don’t want to go out, eat, and it seems like no one is interested into talking to me. I listen to music all day and lay in bed. I don’t feel like going to school any more and ask my parents if I can stay home and do it online. I recently moved schools and left all my old friends and now I literally have no one to talk to. I tried talking to my dad today but he was just shaking his head and agreeing with me no matter what I said. My step mom is acting like I’m not even alive. My bio mom won’t let me see my siblings, I try to and she says maybe next weekend (she has said this since the beginning of this summer) I Honestly don’t know what to do at this point.

Text: I'll be straight forward, I'm not diagnosed yet. I haven't really been checked so I may still very well suffer from the condition, but I apologize if I don't qualify to post here. So my problem begins maybe three years back. Out of nowhere I'm randomly sad about myself for no reason in particular. I brushed it off as regular old sadness and have no other thought. Then a couple months later I notice it's happening more and more frequently. I thought it could genuinely have been depression, but I was convinced into brushing it off as teen angst. 

Over the next year it stayed the same, random bouts of sadness and lack of motivation for a day or two at the time. 

Fast forward to now and I've started being sad nearly daily. I can sometimes go a week and rarely close to a month without experiencing severely as I have, but like I said that's it sometimes. I have suicidal thoughts so often they've stopped bothering me. I quite often cry at night and have recently started drinking when this happens. I sometimes think I want to die but I know there are people who care. I have a loving family and great friends. I just can't get what I want out of life and I don't want to live a long unfulfilled life. Don't get me wrong, I'd much rather be happy and live for as long as possible, but part of me wants to give up. I'm not asking for professional diagnosis, but would you say this is regular sadness or am I verging on depression? 

Thanks, anon

Text: I’m fourteen, family life isn’t great at all (doesn’t even talk to them. As i do not want to because they are negative people) hygiene...yeah let’s not even talk about that- and all in all? life sucks. Miserable asf but i don’t wanna be this way anymore. i wanna be happy. Wanna be successful. Wanna be the best i can be. 

But it’s hard when you’ve been like this for so many years now. 


(Family is just.... no.)

BUT. now that i’m old enough to get a job, and actually wants to get better for the first time in my life- i wanna start. But I wanna know HOW?? How can I do that? I need some guidelines, some tips, rules- SOMETHING. to get be going. So dropping some down would be nice.

Text:  I will try to be brief   


 My older brother does not stop wanting to educate me in his own way and criticize my personality and my lifestyle  I have reached the point of not knowing what to do in my house for fear that he will get angry for something that he does not think of me  

He has called me mediocre, blackmailer, he accused me of brainwashing my mother to turn her against him , he also has said to me I don't have real depression 

We live in the same house and with the pandemic my mental health has been greatly affected by his attitude, he is 10 years older than me I'm 20

How can I deal with this efficiently without affecting my mother?

Text: Hello everyone.

For years now I've had a really hard time waking up in the morning, and I'm only able to get up at a reasonable time if it's an absolute necessity.  Even then I usually sleep in too long and am late for things.

It generally doesn't matter how much sleep I get, I still feel tired.  I can be super motivated to get up early as I'm going to bed, but I'll still feel like a zombie when I try to wake up and won't even bother.

I've started exercising more and feel a bit better in general, but still haven't found a way to fix this particular issue.  I don't know why something so simple is this difficult.

Any advice aside from "Just get up!" would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Text: I'm 31 F and have never had a boyfriend. I feel defective. After about a dozen dates or so I get dumped or guys start treating me like shit. 

I just got dumped by a really great guy. He said he wasnt ready for a relationship. Yet he messaged me first online, we texted almost daily for over a month, and went on real dates. I feel like this was the nice way of saying he just isnt that into me. He even met some of my friends. He told me I was the sweetest girl he ever dated. Then why would he never want to see me again?

I dont have much experience considering most people my age are at a minimum living with their partner if not married with kids. I cant figure out why I'm so undesirable. It's been like this ever since I was 16. I was always a secret. An embarrassment. 

I was doing so much better with my depression and now I'm back at square one. I'm randomly crying at work, I either feel intense pain or numb, I relive the act of being dumped and my stomach drops all over again, and  I'm seriously wondering if life is worth it if I never have someone love me.

I take meds, go to therapy. But it's not helping. I'm overweight so I cant help but think some of the reason why my dating pool sucks is because I'm ugly. I havent been eating really and when I do I purge. I've lost almost 4lbs this week. 

I feel like something very real is missing in my life and after yet another rejection I dont have any hope left. I dont know how much longer I can go on feeling this bad.

Text: I very always had a lazy streak but have worked years. I got laid off around a year ago. I guess I'm depressed because I can't get back on track. I'm very shy I don't like being around people even though I have been but now I liked it even less and I'm not even looking for a job I'm just living off what I saved for years. And I don't go out much actually I've been like a hermit for almost a year so I was wondering if anybody actually was like this as well?

Text: My friend has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. He changed how I view the world and idk what i'd do without him. I rely on him for helping me work through my anxieties, which often revolve around complex sociological and existential questions. Recently he started college, and he hasn't really seemed to have time for me. Questions and anxieties pile up in his pms and he only occasionally responds. I can't lose him.

Text: Hello Reddit. for a little backstory, I'm 15 years old and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over two years ago. It has definitely gotten worse sense then, and I have not talked to a counselor since. Last November, I dropped out of my high school to begin home schooling with a tutor due to social anxiety and my depression hitting a low point. Though I enjoy the environment and freedom that comes with home schooling much better, it does get very lonely. The only people I talk to now are my long distance boyfriend, a couple online friends, and my family (who are very busy with their own work and school) Along with my family being busy, I hardly ever mention my depression to them. If I do, I feel like I'm wasting their time and they'll be disappointed in me. My depression has gotten increasingly worse over the past few months. I've always been skinny, but I've lost a significant amount of weight to the point it's unhealthy. I have no appetite, no desire to do anything, and no one to talk to. With the start of summer, my day consists of laying around and watching TV or playing video games. Even if plans do come up, physical symptoms of anxiety like panic attacks, head aches, and stomach aches typically prevent me from going. My boyfriend wants me to see a counselor, But I'm hesitant because the one I had previously didn't help much, and was very expensive. I worry that by asking my parent's for help, (with my anxiety, depression, and poor eating habits) I'll be wasting their money and time. At the same time, I'm afraid that if I continue to sit here and do nothing I won't live to see my 16th birthday. What should I do? Any tips on getting help and finding meaning and motivation in life at a young age?

Text: I just don’t get why everyone hates me, especially irl. No one wants to talk to me or do anything with me but at the same time, the same people do stuff with everyone else. No one wants to be my friend. No one wants to be my girlfriend. Online people always leave me even when they say they won’t. The best friend I ever had left me almost 2 months ago and I really miss her. I just don’t get why everyone hates me. I didn’t do anything wrong to them. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me.

Text: Hi everyone, please don't bite my head off as I'm pretty new to all this but I'm trying to figure out if what I'm feeling is depression or not. I recently realised that I've not been feeling okay for quite a few years, I googled some stuff and depression came up. Now I don't really trust random stuff that's written online so I  thought the best thing to do was  to speak to some people with depression on here and see if my symptoms fit? 

- no motivation to get out of bed, if my parents didn't force me to get up then I'd probably stay there until the late afternoon. 

- I always like I've been a disappointment, that I'm a failure and that I'll always be this way later in life 

- I find it very hard to focus on anything, my attention span is very low. I fidget and become aggiated pretty easily 

- I quite often find it hard to get to sleep, I'll end up staying awake until the early hours of the morning. 

I spend almost all day in my room. I feel empty, lonely and sometimes start crying over the past or present. 

- sometimes I make myself cry on purpose when I'm alone, I don't quite understand why I do that. 

- I find it hard to motivate myself to do basic things such as washing or brushing my teeth. I do them for my own good but it takes effort and I sometimes neglect those tasks. 

- I sometimes think about death. 

- I find it hard to care about anything. Then if I make a mistake over something I do find the energy to care about, I beat myself up about it harshly.

Text: So let's say I'm elevated and happy the whole day and about to meet my girlfriend tommorow and she cancels because she feels tiered.

My whole mood goes down down deep in the depths of hell everytime someting slightly bad happends while I'm happy.
Is someone else experiencing this?

Also if I'm feeling dreadful and someone invites me to a birthday party  or an event I get hyped and I'm happy until the event ends. And then I'm back feeling like shit and questioning is life really worth it and I'm angry at everything. I'm 16 btw

Text: So my ex girlfriend was going through a rough time with her depression and ended the relationship to say that it wasn't fair on me and that she needed to focus on herself. She still wanted to be friends and we've chatted off and on for a few weeks but recently she's gone radio silent, leaving my messages unread. Even after we broke up it had been a back and forth between who started conversations.

I don't know if this is her way of letting things fizzle out entirely or if this is her depression taking a turn for the worst. I can see that she's been online (thanks invasive apps tracking login/active times) so at least I know she's still alive but I'm worried about her.

Deep down I still love her and I care about her as a friend but I'm a little lost on what to do. I want to give her space but I suppose I also want a definitive answer as to whether things are over in terms of friendship and I feel guilty and selfish.

I don't want to smother her or take too much of a step back but my experience of depression is non-existent. I don't know if this is normal behaviour for a depressive state or if anybody has some tips for approaching something like this or general tips for being a good friend for someone with depression but I'd appreciate any pointers.

Text: Can someone please explain?

So i dated this guy one year ago. He became severely depressed and we kept texting when he felt like it. He doesn’t really talk to me about it because he doesn’t want to burden me (it’s annoying). He is seeing a therapist once a week and is taking all kinds of medication. 

I made him a christmas package. With gifts, food, and a selfmade depression journal (see my other post). And i can’t wait to cheer him up with it. 

I texted him last Thursday if i could bring it. He seemed happy about it and we agreed to meet that evening. But then he texts me last minute saying his best friend is at his place and he forgot they were going to have diner together. He then gave me all kinds of new options, and I then asked if today was okay, but i still didn’t get a text back... (it has been 3 days)

I don’t know what to do anymore. Should i send him another text? Ugh I am trying to support him but he keeps letting me down every time. 
He is with his best friend literally every second of the day, it seems like he can’t be alone. But he also seems to be unable to text me back? 

I don’t understand. I really don’t. I read books, i talked to you guys, and i educated myself about depression, but i am so tired. Can somebody please try to explain? I don’t even know what i should do with the christmas box anymore... advice is really appreciated

Text: Antidepressants

Hi!

I’ve been thinking to take antidepressants for a while now. I have sudden outbursts (or breakdown episodes (?)) wherein I just cry and cry. I can feel the physical pain in my chest, or heart, specifically. It’s so heavy. I’ve been seeing a psychotherapist for a few months already, but it doesn’t seem to help. It started because of work which I already resigned from 2 months ago. And then this pandora’s box (collection of traumatic events in my subconscious) seem to have been opened so I’ve been still experiencing the breakdowns despite seeing a psychologist.

For people who took antidepressants: Was it worth it? How was your experience with it? Did it help? 

Im sorry I just needed answers. I have no friends who took antidepressants before. Im also shy to reach to them, especially now that I need them the most. 

Thank you, strangers.

Text: I have this horrible self esteem issues and I'm very self conscious about myself. I have a very plumpish figure, i compensate the lack of exercise with IF and calorie count. The reason why there's a lack of exercise is due to insecurity, embarrassment and fear.  The fear of people making fun of me, judging me while I clumsily exercise and get out of breath. 

My psychiatrist has been trying and trying to push me. Questioned me if it really matters if they judged, when my health is concern. I know what's right and what's wrong. I know that it shouldn't matter. I know that my health is much more important than what others think. I just can't manage to bring myself to do it. Its a struggle. He lost it and calmly said he won't see me until I do something. After the appointment I left and I head to the restroom and bawled my eyes out. Hes somebody dear to me, and I always look forward to seeing him every week. I'm so useless that i am unable to muster the courage to exercise to the extent of him not wanting to see me. I am beyond useless and hopeless. It's better to die than to confront the person who listens to you when you have let them down.

Its tiring.

Text: I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and I’ve recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also can’t feel any pain, some might think it’s a gift but it’s a fucking curse. I’m numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I haven’t eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. I’ve been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and can’t physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. I’d get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her “accidents”. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasn’t scared, or worried, I was calm, and didn’t even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasn’t sad or scared. Ever since then, it’s just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was “ok”. Honestly it was probably best for her, I don’t know if I can feel love anymore, so what’s the point of trying. I recently noticed I can’t physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didn’t feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’d say I’m terrified, but I’m not even sure I can feel terrified anymore. I just need help. I’m sorry for how long this paragraph is. I know most of you won’t even read it all, I know I probably wouldn’t. If you did read it all, thank you. I just need help, and at this point in my life I could use any help I can get.

Text: umm..this  is my first post on reddit and I haven't been a stable emotional state  for quite sometime now. so...coming to the details,

I\[18/F\]  am having a lot of insecurities, self esteem and confidence issues and I  guess all this started during high school, when I was at the bottom of  the class and i began to feel inferior to my peers and no matter how  hard I tried I still couldn't catch up(I was a straight A student before  high school). and then came college. well, college isn't that bad. I  have always been a very emotional person and I experience a lot of mood  swings. So lately i have been quite down and stressed as I am very  anxious about my career(still clueless). and as a result I haven't been  able to control my emotions. It feels like I'm walking on thin ice and  anyone,literally anyone, can make a small remark and *\*shatter\**  and I'm back to drowning in a cold sea of emotions.I spend a lot of  time crying. I just have no control over it. I want to stop crying, i  tell my self to stop crying and i can't and its so goddamn frustrating.  It makes me feel weak(I am already physically weak and underweight). I  know expressing emotions and letting it out is healthy, but what if you  are feeling so emotionally saturated with all the self hate and worries  that you'd cry to anything. I at least wish i had enough control so i  wouldn't cry in front of someone who is not close. but nope. I have zero  control.

let me quote this one incident.  a few days ago, I snapped at my elder brother when he was pressuring me  to do learn things for my career. He kept forcing his point and it made  me feel small and incompetent and like he doesn't trust my decisions on  what I wanted to learn so I began to get all defensive and I very  rudely told him off and avoided him ever since. I spent a lot of time  crying and affected by it. And just when I had slowly recovered from it,  a family member on hearing what exactly happened made a remark that "I  think he's better than you, for the family" which means that I am too  impulsive and rude and emotional and is bound to create problems in a  family.I still haven't recovered from that. I didn't want to cry,  because my uncle and I don't exactly see eye to eye and I wanted to  disregard this remark and get going with my day. BUT i began to tear up  the next second. I cried for hours.

I  hated myself. Do i wish to be rude? no. Am I this emotional by choice?  no. Do feel crying is the solution to all my problems? no. And my family  thinks otherwise for all the above questions

I  want to seek professional help. Having been wanting to for three years  now. But here's the thing. I am from India. I am still in college. I  live with my family and they provide for me. They will never accept  depression as real and a therapist is a big **NO**. I can never open up to them about this and I can't secretly visit one, nor can I afford it myself.

I  am writing here because I want to change this. I don't want to be  controlled by my emotions all the time, I don't want to use rudeness as  defence. I am so insecure and I am desperately looking for ways to  improve.

**tl;dr**  I am a depressed, insecure, self hating person who cries way too much  and is controlled by her emotions and is desperately looking for ways to  improve

Text: I've spent so much time thinking about killing myself, even had dreams where I have put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger. Just every time I'm thinking I drift towards thoughts of suicide. I just don't see the purpose in anything at all. Every time I try to think myself out of it I just fall back into thoughts of suicide again. Like the finishing thought behind all my thoughts is suicide and nothing else matters.

I just feel like unless I kill myself I'll just be here waiting to kill myself until I finally do it. At this point I'm not even sad anymore, I'm just THAT tired of being alive. I have nothing to gain from continuing to live, I'd rather just be at eternal peace after death over each day being wasted time after time after time again. I don't know what to do. Love is the only thing that I could imagine that could pull me away from these thoughts but then there's nobody who loves me, or understands me or wants to spend each day together. So I'm just left lonely and at that I'd rather have been dead.

Text: I’m not clinically diagnosed, and can’t get a proper diagnosis or medication. I’m under my parents insurance plan and there is a stigma within my family and culture about mental health. I struggle with body image issues that got a lot worst since the pandemic. I can’t ever focus with my school work any more. I have no motivation to do any of my work (but I still do it), it’s hard waking up. I’m constantly in bed when I should be working out or doing my school work. I feel numb pretty much everyday. I don’t have suicidal thoughts but I just don’t have the “motivation to live” or to do anything that would help my life. What can I do? I can’t constantly feel like this, and I can’t get behind in school, I need advice/help.

Text: The light at the end of the tunnel is getting darker and longer. I lost both my jobs prier to COVID and have watched my savings account deplete. I also just saw one of my old positions posted on a job search website meaning I was apparently not  up to par w/ my position although they made it seem like it was nothing  personal . I’ve been forced to abruptly end a 7 year co dependent cycle w/ a guy who moved another woman in and started a life W/ her that I use to beg him for. I went on another date yesterday and was told he  “wasn’t looking for anything serious right now” that  statement makes me feel like I just once again wasn’t up to par. I’m sick and tired of being rejected in my career and love life as the universe continues to slap me in the face Time and time again, I don’t see the point in settling for  some soulless job , being treated by men like I’m disposable. And just living a totally empty ass life as I watch my mental health continue to suffer. And to eventually just grow old and  physically deteriorate too. Life feels so grueling and I’m pretty much numb inside.

Text: So my hate is even getting worse to be honest I just hate my friends and everyone. I regret ever meet them to be honest even tho I don't want to think like this. They did nothing wrong I just have deep hate and it's annoying it repeats in my head and I want to punch something really bad but I hold it back. 

Man I am just completely sad like I really am sad man I don't do shit I like anymore I want to find something to numb the pain and I want to hurt my self with something man just don't know what tho.


All this verbal abuse shit that I still goes on in my life made me think about love completely different then anyone to be honest I will probably not even ask anyone out to be honest just might not even going to try.

Anyone that trys to be nice to me I tend to say thank you but in reality I doubt myself I don't think anyone likes me even my own parents I just don't trust much feelings anymore just does not even matter to me I see it as a joke to be honest.

I am probably going back to my really bad phase of depression I think happen in 9th grade even thought of killing myself even if I go back to that phase I won't kill myself 

Only two of my friends knows this will probably tell them about this shit sooner or later idk

Text: my dad and mom always physically fought, throwing shit, punching, knocking over shit, they divorced, and we separated from our dad, we preferred our mom way more, our dad is shitty in the fact that he constantly gaslights, tries to guilt us, and won’t let us any privacy, well when we were just with our mom, life was good, until our dad told the court he wanted time with us, and now i’m having to do 50/50 custody, recently my mom has gotten a boyfriend and they have had twins, it started off good atfirst in 2018, however the stepfather always leaves the house for days on end without saying shit leaving our mom in a bad mood, in any case she says she’s done trying with him and that she jusr wants to focus on us, yet she goes out and stays up till five am with him drinking when he comes back, every morning when she’s sober she says it won’t happen again, and yet it’s been happening for 2 years straight, in between my mom who is starting to get as bad as our dad having financial problems, my mom always having court calls during the day and our shitty dad who i can’t list all the things he does as it would go on forever, i feel trapped, these are the people responsible for my life for the next four years? i can’t beat it, as well as i hate my general appearance and that i don’t have much friends and the ones i do have i feel are fake as they never talk to me or invite me to anything outside of school, and my online friends are always dicks to me if i don’t agree with everything they say, overall my life is shit, and with school about to start up i have to take a 2 week trip across the us with my father to meet his side of the family, i can’t take it, i don’t know where to go, i feel miserable, i can’t handle this life for the next 4 years, i need help.

Text: I (17m) moved to Houston from Toronto last January and I have kept in contact with one of my friends in Toronto (17f) who is clearly struggling with her mental health. We stay in contact over snapchat and she's opened up to me a few times and I've tried to be as supportive as possible. The last snap I got from her she said something about how she's "not sure she can make it through the next couple weeks." I've never experienced any mental health struggles as severe as what she is going through so I don't think I'm in a great place to give advice. I've tried to just listen to her and be supportive so far but it doesn't seem to be helping her much. The physical distance between us makes it even harder for me to see how she's doing as I don't get to see her at school on an everyday basis like I used to. What I can I do to best help her without being pushy? And are there any resources that I could/should reccomend to her?
Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

Text: I'm a 22 yo guy from India and I'm really depressed. Why mention my country? Because everytime I make a friend on reddit, eventually I tell them where I'm from and I never hear back from them after that. 
Anyways, I graduated college last year and I work from home these days. I spend most of my time working on weekdays. And I spend my weekends lying in bed all day and listening to asmr. I don't feel I have anything in life anymore that really makes me happy. I've got a couple friends in this city but I don't feel like meeting anyone. I don't feel like watching anything on tv either. Idk nothing makes me happy anymore. There's nothing that I look forward to anymore. The things that I think I might enjoy- it feels like the effort required to do those things is much more than the pleasure I'll get out of them. I just don't feel like doing anything anymore. The little energy I have all goes into my job- even in that aspect I thing I'm just getting by. I feel so tired and unhappy and empty and bored all the time. I want to be happy but there's nothing that makes me happy anymore. Nothing worth doing. 
I was hoping I could find a friend here and idk we could just help each other get better. Idk how.. but it might be helpful talking to someone who's going through the same thing.

Text: I´m 19 and I always say, to myself, that I feel like an old woman who has lived three times already. I am so sick of everything. I know very well, that this thought is not normal but damn I dream about being hospitalized, filled with pills just to forget that I´m still alive. I don´t want to be aware of anything. 

I´m tired of life. I´m mad at myself because I don´t trust anyone enough to talk about my problems. I wish I had the balls to end it but I don´t. Not because I´m afraid to fail, but because I don´t want to leave my parents behind thinking it was their fault. 

I´m sleeping up to 14 hours a day (especially bc of quarantine) and I wish it was more.

Text: This year's been shit, I just can't deal with it anymore. I've tried so hard to be strong and do everything i could to feel better but it's just gotten too much. 

Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world (that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed), but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldn't feel better, I'd sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what I've been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. 

In retrospect it's probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didn't. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I don't really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after it's been diagnosed, a complete mess. 

Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didn't exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldn't be going out. That's when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my family's health, but eventually I was sent in to school. 

Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. I've always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. 

I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. 

School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly weren't having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didn't feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didn't, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. 

My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didn't really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more. I got swarmed with homework again, having to finish two full art projects and some other things I forgot, but my family was going on a trip over the weekend (at this point I stopped fighting over quarantining it was clear they didn't listen to my concerns) so I wouldn't be able to work on it much. Everything just built up to this point where something as relatively small as having to finish a project just made me snap. The night before the trip I just freaked out, I was a mess of tears and slamming stuff around my room while packing. I remember cutting my finger, I don't know why it's just what I went too, I felt awful after it, it hurt a lot and while it calmed me down I just felt so embarassed and ashamed that I did it. That weekend everytime my finger brushed against something even slightly I just got reminded of what I did to myself, it was horrible. 

Sometime after or before, I have no idea really, something similar happened. I didn't do a couple of random spanish assignments in school and those appearently counted as quizes without us being told, causing my grade to drop to a solid 30 or 40. Again this was a pretty small problem that was cleared up shortly after but things built up so much that something like this was a breaking point. The night before a big spanish test that would either save or ruin my grade, I was completely overwhelmed again and just broke down, my mom was annoyed I was making noise that late and she kind of just aggressively told me to calm down a bunch but it only got worse. It just all felt so hopeless, but it was the first time in a while that I felt grounded in a way, that I ws actually there presently instead of just going through the motions, but the whole situation hurt. 

These downward spirals never really got better. Those were the worst examples but the time in between those was filled with me feeling a crushing sense of hopelessness and exhaustion constantly. I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me. This continued for months, I just felt awful constantly it felt like there was always something small that would show up and throw me off again. I remember another break down about two months ago when I was out seeing colleges, I just stayed up awake for hours one night crying to myself and venting to some friends. Something about how I tried to hard to have things be better, I spent so long trying to draw, and write and do everything that I enjoy while balancing school but it just wouldn't work, it kept getting worse instead of better. I was just tired, I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted to be happy but it only got worse. It felt like there was no reason for any of this, I was just here feeling like shit for no reason, I wanted it to end so badly. 

Around this time the school announced their full time in person plan, leaving my parents and me too fight about whether or not I should go back in to school. The same arguments happened and eventually I was sent in again. The first day back was some of the most intense anxiety I've ever felt, just pure feer and overwhelmingness about the very uncomfortable situation I was in. 

That leads me to now, the most recent random period of stress that makes me finally say I can't do this anymore. Three weeks ago review for the AP Lit exam started (a standardized test final for a literature class, known for being very poorly designed) and I realized our teacher taught my class next to nothing about literature the whole year and I was on my own to prepare. The whole overwhelming thing happened again, it just felt like my whole life would revolve around this pointless exam for about an entire month, leaving me with no time to do the few things that actually make me happy anymore. That night I went in the kitchen and just held a knife, I just sat on the floor crying for a while, I know I wouldn't do anything but the thought of it alone terrified me. I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldn't. I didn't think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said that's just life, there's always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldn't cope with that anymore, I couldn't cope with that awful reality. I just didn't enjoy living anymore, and if it's this bad now as only a highschooler I couldn't imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again I'd ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. 

Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT (another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast) in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I don't think that's happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. 

So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I don't want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, I'm so tired of everything, I've been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why won't I feel better? I have a test for my driver's license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life? I'm tired of it all, why won't it get better? When will it end? Is there even a way to cope anymore?

Text: So my boyfriend told me that he was in a bad place before he met me &amp; that nowadays (the entirety of being with me) he’s been happy &amp; hasn’t felt sad in a minute. Today somehow the topic of being sad came up &amp; I was like “why would you be sad again?” &amp; he responded with “because it always relapses. That’s how depression works.” &amp; I was speechless. I understood that he used to have breakdowns (they all, 2-3 in total, included something that was about me.) but I never guessed that he’d have depression. I’m a generally very happy person &amp; I’m not sure how to deal with this. I don’t think he’s professionally diagnosed because I do remember him saying it feels like he’s depressed but never said he was diagnosed. I don’t want to doubt him but at the same time I don’t think what he’s feeling is something as severe as depression. I don’t know what to do. Should I just support him either way? If so, how am I supposed to support someone when they’re having depressing episodes?

Text: Like, okay, I get it partly because I wouldn't want to be friends with me either probably? But also, I just want to know what I am doing wrong? I can be talking to people and have a great friendship with them and then they just totally... Disappear? Whenever I've reached out, we might have a very distant conversation and then that conversation stops and we just don't talk again for ages unless I contact them. And even then, it's just the same thing? So eventually I stop reaching out and they never send me anything. And this has happened multiple times with people I was very close with. 

What the fuck is so wrong with me that no one wants to stay? I want people to be close with or at least talk to but everytime I just end up getting hurt. Everything hurts tonight

Text: Hi im writing this from my art school's bathroom (sorry for bad english).

I always struggle with low self esteem, i was bullied at school, made fun because of my appearance,etc.  I feel like i'm a shitty artist when i see my classmate's work or i feel like i am not smart or feel like people think i'm dumb. I've been having gender dysphoria this past few years and i don't know what  i want; i never liked being so masculine, i hate my body hair. I always dreamed to be more affeminate and androgynous, but i don't know if i really want to be a full woman. I never had a girlfriend (which is one the reasons why usually y feel like i'm ugly),i want to have one cause i feel lonely sometimes. I procastinate a lot and i feel anxious when thinking about my future (i have OCD and Tourette) cause i think i'm not going to succeed. 

  So basically i am super insecure, i don't have much self esteem, i feel like i don't have any talent, no chance in getting a partner; feel like i'm ugly, and failure and i can't stop worrying about what others think or about irritating others or being shitty with them. Please i apologise for any grammatical error, i have to go back to class.

Text: I’m in the midst of a 5 week bout with depression, which for me has nothing to do with sadness. Rather, depression for me is a horrifying head fog that *disconnects* me from all emotions, interests and appetites. All I can feel is the fear and anxiety of being in this state of mind. If you suffer from this flavor of depression, or any flavor, do you force yourself to do the things your normally love even though you can’t connect with that feeling of enjoyment? For me, doing this and not getting the reward makes it all worse, but I also don’t wanna wait around to feel better to do these things, If that makes any sense.

What do you do in this situation?

Thank you!!

Text: I feel like my depression will never get any better. I can't get out of bed, yet I feel guilty for not working. I've barely eaten - the idea of food makes me feel ill - but I feel bad for not eating. I'm failing my exams and have no long-term goals, because even as an "adult" at 19 I don't know what I want to do with my life. I've spent most of the last couple of days staring at the ceiling feeling terrible in every way.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. And my parents don't think that my disorder/disability ([Tourette's syndrome](https://tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/#1461071540054-f0944fbc-3f2b)) exists, so I get told off regularly for something I physically cannot control.

Thoughts of wanting to self-harm have come back after a few months of not harming, and I just feel like I want to die. Just this morning I was looking through the medications we have at home to see what sort of thing could kill me with an overdose. The flair is "requesting support", but I only put that because it needs a flair. Just ignore this, it doesn't matter.

Text: Im 24(f) and I cannot function as an adult. 
I can go to work. I can make money, but my executive function is so bad, I can't bring myself to pay bills, my friend has to remind me to eat, I forget to shower, I forget to do normal life things. I just got laid off. I can't do anything but watch YouTube videos. I can't keep dates straight. I constantly forget about doctors appointments. I've tried everything short of getting a personal assistant. 

I don't understand many social situations. Dating and making good friends is increasingly more difficult. I'll trust literally anyone. 

When I was younger my mother thought I might be on the spectrum but the doctor wouldn't test me because I was very social. 

The depression is getting so bad. I want to go to sleep and not wake up. I don't know whats wrong with me, or why I literally cannot do day to day activities. 

Im just posting hoping someone can help me and give me a direction to go in.

Text: Today is my 16th birthday. I am all alone, i have no one to spend it with. No one even remember my birthday, no one said it either. I have been contemplating suicide and jave been looking forward to today in hopes that something would change. But nothing did. And if on mt special day nothing changes, then will anything ever really change? I decided no, and I made my final decision on whether or not i should follow through with whats been on my mind. And i decided I will. There is no point, I'm not happy and im always alone. This is my goodbye. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think that's what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. I'm just another guy on the street to everyone. This will probably get buried but oh well..

I have posted this on another subreddit. So if you see this twice that is why.

Text: Hello all, Im not sure if I am depressed or bipolar but i would like advice on how you know? I am fine when I'm with my friends and feel happy but when I'm alone I go sad and overthing stuff. I'm starting to use alcohol when I feel like this and don't want to end up with alcoholism. I might just be sat about current situations due to my thought path but I overthink and go to the worst thought straight away. Was fine earlier, but now I feel an overwhelming sadness, the other night I just cried for no reason or maybe it was something and I was just avoiding accepting what it was but I dunno.
Sorry if this doesn't belong here but I need some advice, thank you

Text: 
maximus came home almost four years ago, after enduring years of abuse. he was a 90 pound hunk of love who thought he weighed about 5 pounds. most handsome boy youve ever seen, a pitbull with the biggest block head that i love more than anything. he always had to be by my side, and i always had to be by his. i would lay on the floor with him any chance i had, and he would always angle his head down and just collapse his body into my lap. my boy loved to get dressed up- a bandana around his neck always made him sit up a little taller, and walk a little prouder. 

he got a rough start, having been used as a bait dog for the first half of his life. his body was permanently marked with scars from where evil scum had cut him repeatedly. when we found each other at the shelter, he had been there for 9 months and been adopted out and taken back quite a few times. ill never be able to wrap my mind around the fact no one else kept him, but im so thankful they didnt and that he waited for my family. he was missing almost all his teeth from chewing rocks, and was blind in his left eye. he has seen and experienced the worst humankind has to offer yet still had more love for us than you could ever imagine. he was my big, goofy, happy happy guy. the biggest regret i have is that i didnt get to him sooner than i did. 

Maximus didnt want to eat anything the past few days, and was more sluggish than usual. my mom took him to the vet yesterday just to make sure nothing was actually wrong, and they told us his red blood count was low and he needed a blood transfusion. it was serious but no reason he wont recover from it. we took him from there to emergency vet, where they ran tests and did scans. the vet said he has never seen anything like what was shown on those scans, that my sweet maximus was a very very sick little boy. the inside of his spleen was supposed to look like peanut butter, but instead it looked like chunky jelly with chunks and lumps he could not identify. his body had developed multiple tumors, which were cancerous. he had gone into “tumor lysis crisis” meaning that a large amount of the cancer cells that were comtained in these tumors died, and released their cancerous contents into his blood. they were killing his red blood cells and destroying the ability to regenerate any at all. his stomach had bloated 3x its normal size, even though it was just later in the day and yesterday morning it had looked fine. 

the vet discouraged us from treatment because he didnt see any possible way maximus could recover- putting him on treatment would only prolong his suffering and ensure he passed painfully. which is cruelly ironic, as putting him on treatment would keep my suffering at bay. but i have to do right by my boy. he’s been through too much and endured more than i can imagine, he was brought into this world in pain and i promised him when i brought him home he would leave it in love. i had to keep that promise. i love him more than it seems like my heart can handle, and making the right decision for him is the absolute utterly wrong decision for me. 

we got the vet this morning and despite not moving except to lift his head the past few days, he trotted off away from the building. i believe in the deepest place of my heart he knew what we were there for, and he was scared. he wouldnt let me turn him around back toward it, and the most he would take was two steps toward the building and then sit back down. i sat down with him and just sobbed. the thought of not having that big brown baby rips my heart into shreds and pierces my soul. 

we finally got him inside after i just sat with him and talked to him for about 15 minutes. ive never wanted to simply wait in a waiting room longer, but they called us right back. i prayed that the doctor was tied up and would take a while before she got back there, but no sooner did i finish thinking that she came in. i felt myself detach from my body at that point. i cant remember anything she said, but i know from the time she came in the room to the time she left the room was only about five minutes. 

my babys body was so tired, it had been fighting so hard for so long. he was gone before the injection to stop his heart was even finished. 

my world and heart suddenly felt so... empty. 
i was wailing in the vets office, the pain is so deep. the doctor told me our grief is only a reflection of our love, and i believe that 100%. i genuinely dont think i could love my boy even an OUNCE more because my little heart would give out. 

im back home now, my other dogs don’t understand why their brother isnt here. i never ever expected my maximus to be the first to go. i have two other senior dogs, and maximus is the youngest. i felt so sure i had at least 3-4 more years with him, and i feel so robbed. i wasnt remotely prepared, i had zero clue this was coming. the one comfort i have is i dont feel remorse over the amount of time i spent with him. i dont feel like i wish i wouldve sat with him and pet him more because that dog was at my side constantly. any spare second i have im laying with him. anywhere i go, hes the one that gets up in the car and rides with me. he loves a car ride. i always surprise him with a mcdouble, and the excitement he shows never ever ever gets old. im not prepared for all of that to be a fond memory. im scared, because i know in time ill forget how it felt to pet that big block head and i dont ever want to. i tried to memorize everything i could about the way he feels, so i hope its a long time before that happens. but for right now all i can think about is how it felt holding him and petting him and how it felt. 

ive been in a bad depressive state the past few weeks, and i dont know how im ever going to feel okay again. maximus is my comfort, i seek him out when im sad because of the comfort he brings, and now he’s not here to comfort me when i need it the most. 

please be kind to me, im not in a good place right now. 

Thank you for listening ❤️ -K

Text: Worst new year ever

My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything until 3 am when I literally just got over a few days ago? It’s been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us- work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and he’s a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because he’s doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was “ I miss you. happy New Years” and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now it’s the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed- and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits ( fast food delivery 😬, and grocery delivery because sometimes I’m too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son). Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause I’ve missed out being a young mom with no help; had a New Years party.. didn’t even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..

Text: So I’ve just been feeling really depressed in a really long time. I would say last year I was extremely suicidal and I was on the verge of ending my life. But then it got complicated I got help and blah blah... I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but I’m not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. 

I mean I’m not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didn’t want even live. I’m just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. It’s really getting draining.

 Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds aren’t working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion.

And I’m totally fine so you don’t need to message me, please save it for someone in urgent need! I am receiving regular therapy and am well supported :)

Text: I came out to my dad as Agender about... 3 months ago? I think? Either way, he’s not respecting me at all, and thinks that now that I’ve come out, he can still call me by she/her pronouns and act like I’m a girl, while I’m also okay and experience no Gender Dysphoria at all. This is clearly not true. My parents being divorced already makes me depressed enough, then you add this, and tons of anxiety, you don’t get a good result. In fact, you get the opposite, you get me. Don’t really know what the point of this was, just wanted to put it out there that if anyone has any suggestions, it would be cool to hear them.

Text: I'm on, what I understand is mild, 15 mg of escitalopram. I usually acknowledge the need for medication after a particularly hard low point. I take them everyday until I feel like I'm in a good place. I even start wondering if it even does anything and if I even need it. So I stop.

A considerable amount of time later, I start circling the drain, going from lethargic to suicidal. 

Honestly, sometimes I even start wondering if I'm depressed or just sad. It does hit hard, but it doesn't stay as long as majorly depressed. Two weeks is long for me. I think that's why I keep telling myself I can handle it without the meds. 

Part of it is the disdain I feel for people who say they're depressed so easily just because something marginally upsetting happened to them. I start thinking 'Do I really have it that bad? Does this even qualify as depression or am I just being a baby?"

Text: My short story: my mom is a narcissist. I have suffered enough in my life even though I've been always obedient. My relationship with my mom has damaged me, heck it has damaged my whole family. 

Now: I'm married and my husband badly wants kids. He knows my feelings about it (that I don't want any) yet he is still insistent on it. I can't leave him and go back to the hell hole that my narc mom created. My sister also doesn't want kids, so you can see the effects that my mom caused on all of us. 

My issue: How do I love an unwanted child, if I do end up having a kid just to please my husband, because he won't budge. I do love my husband and don't want to leave him. 

They say that you can't control everything, but thinking about becoming a mother gives me anxiety. No one can understand my feelings about this apart from God. 

I don't want to turn into my mother if God forbid I do become one myself.

Tips about how to love an unwanted child, especially if you're a victim of a narc parent, would be very helpful.

Text: I have a friend (teenager), he is good at anything specifically, he doesnt have hobbies, nor does he have anything he wants to do... and naturally depression kicked in, noone noticed for a while, I personally found out about it being serious just about... 3, maybe 4? hours ago... he sent me a message saying "bye, im suiciding" which on its own, with no context, seemed as a stupid stupid joke... so naturally I said that this isn't a topic to joke about, and eventually put some things together: He doesnt have hobbies / goals, He smokes (recently started which is horrible imo), he drinks , and he was known to have been overly depressed before, but nothing came out of it, it seemed like he had a rougher time with small things, I started to get worried so I digged deeper... talked with a few common friends and only 1 was able to be of help, the friend (suicidal) had plans... everything. step. by. step. It was actually pretty .... yikes idk... scary, and I got to talk with him, explained to him as nice as one could, that he needs, and he agreed, and said, what about telling your parents? they sure will helped. what followed had me mute. litterarly. HE DID! and his dad is an alchoolic that doesnt care, overall a cool guy to have a drink with and have some fun talk, but not a dad. for sure not. and his mother seemed really active and protective, which she isn't... he told his mom about his issues, and she said: "well you better get on studying and stop with this (bad word) poopoo" . Which pretty much dug him even further into the hole he is in, I can't help but want to do something, I wont be telling his parents more because I am afraid that he will be punished for speaking his problems out loud, which is wrong, but keeping in mind his parents, not surprising, anything I can do for him?!? I really quite do need this help as I have never been... sad... I've never felt actual sadness... I've felt defeat, anger, pitty, but not sad. I've never felt... deppressed, or done, so I have no idea what it's like and how to solve it... any help would be great . thank you in advance &lt;3

Text: I'm only 12, but I already have certain suicidal thoughts, I know that I won't do it, but it crosses my mind. Ever since I did badly on a math quiz my grade started dropping lower and lower, not to mention the teacher hates me. Unfortunately, I am in a high school level course, and cannot simply ask my teacher to explain. I wake up wanting to just be finished, and fall asleep the same way. I can't even imagine telling this to my parents, or them even beginning to believe me.

Text: Hey guys,

I've been subject to a lot of depression episodes recently, which really sucks because I'm currently actively looking for a job. I started kind of taking care of my depression a few months ago, but I still experience really bad days (suicidal thoughts and such).

The things is, before fully dedicating myself to finding a job, I decided to take a few months off. This means I would allow myself to put my job research on hold while *really* taking measures to work on my depression for the first time in my life. 

The problem I'm facing now during job interviews is the dreaded question "But what have you been doing for the past 5 months? I see no job experience, no nothing." with the nice tone of voice "Have you been doing fuck all? ♥"

I was thus wondering, what would a good answer be to that sort of question?

Cus I'm not sure giving the depression background during an interview would really help my case, and on another end,  I've not been doing "fuck all", just not what they want to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really lost on this point, cus I really want to start working again. I feel like it would be the next step toward winning over this freaking depression.

I don't want to lie during a job interview, because I feel it would give a bad start to a possible work partnership, but on another hand, should I?

&amp;#x200B;

Did you guys ever had to face that situation before?

Any beginning of answer would really help!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a bunch guys, and take care, because you're all awesome!

Text: I don’t have a diagnosis, but that’s mostly because I can’t bring myself to find a therapist yet, for several reasons, but I’m pretty sure I’ve been depressed most of my life, or have something at least 

I haven’t been able to get myself to shower for a few days, I was outside all day and I’m all sweaty today and I feel like I have a layer of filth on me, I didn’t brush my teeth either since yesterday morning and it’s just really hard to get up right now... I can feel myself starting to show UTI symptoms again which is definitely because i can’t get myself to take care of myself... my best friend is breaking up with her long term boyfriend today and is coming over for emotional support, and I don’t want her to see me like this, but I can’t get myself to get up and take care of myself, I’m currently rolled up in my throwaway blanket on top of my bed so I don’t make my regular blankets dirty and I just feel so heavy in my head

Text: I'm in the USA. I have no insurance and effectively no money (like, none; I have some family, but asking them is out of the question). I'm pretty sure something's pretty wrong, considering I've been crying and panicking and bludgeoning myself and thinking about suicide for years now, but I don't have any resources to go to an actual doctor.

Earlier tonight when I was more worked up I called the US national suicide prevention hotline. The guy I talked to gave me the number for mobile crisis services in my (rural) county. I explained my financial/insurance situation to him and he assured me that if I call them, a doctor with this service will come to my location and it's free, no charge…

…but even if it's true, what then?

I can't imagine they're going to actually do anything except take me to a hospital, stick me there for a few days, maybe they give me some medication… and then they release me and tell me to make a follow up appointment with a doctor somewhere I can't pay and probably can't physically get to (no car, rural area), and I get a bill for the hospital stay. Which I categorically will not be able to pay. If that's what would happen, I truly am better off dead.

TL;DR I want help but I strongly suspect that if I ask for any, I'm only going to get the opposite. Am I crazy or am I right?

Text: I started drinking about 8 years ago, and I've been sober for 2 years. Within those 6 years, I went from casually drinking, to drinking a fifth of Vodka a day. It got so bad that if I went without alcohol for a day I would start to have withdrawals. I pawned a lot of my stuff just for alcohol. I destroyed my relationship with my son and his mom. I did a lot of things in that time that I wouldn't ever do today. I look back on it and wonder why I even acted the way I did. I was a complete asshole. Fast forward to today, and I'm still dealing with a lot of issues. I can't function like a normal human being. I've withdrawn myself from almost everyone. I have no desire to go out and make friends or have fun. (Not that I care to have a social life I just figured I'd throw it in there for context). I can't forgive myself for a lot of the things I've done. I don't know how to. I've spent so long punishing myself I don't know how to forgive myself. I want to get better. I want to be happy and have a stable relationship with my son again. I just don't even know where to start. I've tried talking to a therapist before but I didn't really like talking to someone I don't know about my life. I don't like talking to anyone about my feelings. I don't know what else to say. Just started speaking from my mind for a minute. I don't do it often and what better place than here. P.S. I'm atheist so I don't think religion is going to help me with this. 

If you made it to the end I appreciate your time. I hope you have a wonderful day/evening.

Text: I have felt depressed for a while, I have done a lot of things to try and help myself through therapy, sports, working out, videogames, talking to wife, friends and family, church, learning a language, working full time, staying busy, going to university. all I have found is that each time I completely any of these things that I still feel like I am empty.  when I do not do those things for more than 10 mins by myself that my thoughts just get dark and I be little everything I have ever done. I think about all the things that I have done in the past, I have talked to many people about them but the pain is just as deep as before. I have decided to stop talking about the stuff cause I can tell that everyone around me is getting bogged down by it and people are more happy when I pretend to be.

 I am going on trip to the place where all my pain started to hopefully overcome it all and to turn my life around from the pain. I don't know if it will work or not. any tips on what else I can try?

Also I get depressed because I have dreams where I'm constantly bombarded by women who are not my wife who want to have relationships with me and it's a nightly battle to not give in to it when I'm dreaming. I know it sounds silly but I fear that if I give into the dreams that I might do it in real life. I don't want to tell my wife because she doesn't understand other weird dreams that I have had in the past.

Text: I’m kind of sick of walking on eggshells around my dad...
He’s sick and needs to be under watch, and my mom doesn’t have that time while I do, so I chose to stay with him and help around. But its incredibly hard to deal with his mercurial temper - it can change at the drop of a hat! Sometimes all it takes to trigger his rage is a little comment.

I’m tired, my heart is tired. I can’t give up on him because I know its a disease and not really his fault, but I’m made of flesh and blood too!

Does anyone has a way to deal with these kind of situation? Just sitting and enduring verbal abuse is so, so draining... my usual coping method is to wait until his temper cools down and for him to apologize - but everytime this happens I break a little. 

Advice please.

Text: I'm an 18 soon to be 19 in December. I dropped out of school in my second year of 6th form because of depression and I've been stuck in a job I hate since. But I  could tolerate it I thought I could turn it around. But now with all my few friends off to uni I've been feeling exceedingly low the last few months. Like I'm stuck doing something I hate with all my friends going away and no way to make new ones. I'll be honest I really don't know what to do I feel like I've got no way out I don't really have any hobbies I just used to play video games with mates but like I said they're all going away. Either way I hate this and want to change and try and turn my life around but I'm really lost. I feel like I'm out of time and options like I don't think I can go back to school and turn it around from there but I really don't know. Any advice would be appreciated I'm just sick of this.

Text: Hey everyone,

My depression has been out of control over the last year. It's always been bad, but this was the first year where I woke up nearly every day thinking about suicide. I've been seeing a therapist for more than a decade and over that time I've been talked into anti-depressants several times. And without fail none of them helped. 

Prozac, Solexia, Welbutrin, and another I'm blanking on all had no positive effect and untenable sexual side effects. This past year I tried Effexor and had to quit after a month or so because it made me feel emotionally numb and I felt no fear or concern about my growing desire to end my life. Now I'm very apprehensive about even trying another SSRI/SNRI

As of a few days ago I made one last try at maybe getting the Spravato treatment. But because I live in the world's richest third world country(the U.S.), all of my prior SSRI experiences mean nothing. The insurance company requires that I endure at least 3 immediate attempts with drugs they want to cover before they even consider honoring the insurance that I pay them for.

Has anyone similarly developed this apprehension towards antidepressants and eventually found one that worked? I was given a list of more modern SNRI's and I'm fucking terrified that they'll make me feel like he last one and I'll give in and do it.

Text: Have you done it? Did it help? Did it make the person you asked feel weird, even if you were close?

Looking at my daily schedule the amount I sleep in and nap is the most unhealthy and detrimental part (I spend a lot of time ruminating and having negative thoughts and then feel bad since I oversleep, as I am sure a lot of you are familiar with). I asked my friend to call me today and it helped. Even with alarms I don't get up. Hearing an actual person helped, I think.

Text: I’m so tired. So so tired. The more I think about things, the more I’m convinced that the only way to be happy right now is to pump myself up on drugs. 

I’m a 20 year old mechanical engineering student starting his second year soon. I tried to kill myself twice over seeing my friends in better positions than me, and I don’t think I’ll be able to secure a job that gives me enough money to try all the things I want. I’m not graduating from an Ivy League, I’m not a doctor either, so I won’t make enough to travel the world and do the stuff that Instagram and Reddit always puts on my feed. 

Even if I manage to win the lottery or something, I know nothing compares to the ideals that I make up in my head. Nothing on this earth looks fun or interesting anymore. I just wish I can jump into games or books and live my life there where anything is possible, but here, you don’t expect aliens to take you to worlds beyond your imaginations, superpowers, or to save the world. The way I see it, I’ll just be working my ass off with the occasional vacation until the day I decide to kill myself. 

Because of that, I’m not motivated to try hard enough because I know everything is second best to my expectations. What’s the point of trying if you can’t get what you truly want in the end, just a consolation prize? It’s a vicious cycle, and I feel like a car running on an empty tank when I’m not working for myself, but just for external reasons like not wanting to fucking starve when I graduate. 

I’m ready to leave this fucking earth if I know nothing makes me happy anymore. I’ve learned from my past two attempts, and I think the next one will finally work.

Text: I’m 16. I’ve been bullied my whole life and been depressed since I was around 14. I’ve always had this idea that things will get better in the future, “It will be better next year”, “It will be better when I’m 20, 25, 30...” I just realized that it won’t. I, like everyone else, am bound to work ‘til the day I die, but on the top of that, I have to deal with mental illness. Is this a life worth living? I have zero friends, I have no supportive family. Most days I just stand there, staring at the walls, doing nothing. I’m completely uninteresting as a person. Given my high school history, I will certainly not get into a good college. I’m objectively ugly, as I have a very unsymmetrical face. I can’t remember the last time I felt happy; I have nobody left in my life. What’s out there for me?

Text: Quarantine has been rough on me so far. It's practically been undoing months of therapy for me. Every day I wake up, get something to eat and then end up back in bed because I feel so tired. My boyfriend is concerned about the amount of time I spend in bed but I can't help it. 

I don't know how to stop feeling so exhausted from not doing anything. It's hard for me to even pick up my iPad to work on my illustrations. I have a hard time even thinking about getting up and I end up taking an unnecessary nap. My whole life I would hang out in my bed because there wasn't anywhere else for me to be due to my living situation. 

And even now that I'm living with my boyfriend l still have a hard time getting up because I'm just so fucking tired and depressed, I just want to sleep forever until this pandemic is over. I'm starting to question if I even exist at this point. Any kind words would be appreciated. Thank you

Text: Lately I've had a lot of bad days which usually means crying a few times/hours a day. I don't even think about all that time that I wasted or all the emotions I can't deal with, but I am kind of scared for my body. I can feel my whole body clenching and my brain feels like burning or exploding or something I cannot even put into words. I'm afraid that it's affecting my physical health and since I don't see killing myself as an option, I would prefer to have my body working...
I can't even tell if this post is making sense but I had to put it out of my head. I feel like saying that out loud even to my therapist would sound too real and dramatic.

Text: I cant fucking do this. I cant fucking do this. Its been so goddamn long since ive actually felt happy.
I hate myself and i dont really feel like i have anything to look forward to. Ive tried it all, meds, therapy, hobbies,tv shows, books, work. Nothing works. Im still at sqaure one. I still come home ever day barely keeping myself from just ending it.
No one would miss me. Im so fucking generic and useless. Im not even a good person. Truth be told, im defensive and hot tempered to the point where anyone that has made an effort to get closer to me is driven away pretty early. I feel like i have no control over this nightmare rather im just along for the ride. 
Ive tried, i genuinely tried and nothing works.
I feel so isolated.
Im so alone.
I cant tell whats real and whats not.

Not that anyone here really cares, i guess part of me hopes someone will tell me something i havent heard before, some actual advice , thats worked for other people- or at the very least give me a reason not to curl up and die.
Or ill just get the whole "it doesnt work like that" thing
Fuck this is pointless too isnt it.
I hate myself.

Text: Hi,

I'll try to explain my situation as best as I can and I will highly appreciate if you can read it completely. In any case, I'll try to summarize everything in a TLDR at the bottom. Thanks for your time.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an international student who is stuck overseas in my home country (India) due to COVID from the last one and half year. I am studying in a good university on a student loan which is huge. I come from a lower-middle class family and my parents can't even speak English. My parents have very conservative Indian mentality and it is impossible for them to understand my situation.

Just after my high school, I was selected into very prestigious engineering colleges in India called IIT. I studied there for an year and got super depressed as I came to understand how the real life is. I decided to take a transfer to a very good university in Australia. I thought it would make me feel better but it did come with a hefty student loan. I was a kid I guess, I don't think there is anything that can make me feel better.

I am currently in my last year and working towards writing my honours thesis. I have been pretty stressed about general life and how exactly I will repay my loan and live a normal life. I have tried applying to a lot of internships but I got more than 50 rejections already and I have no more motivation to apply anywhere now. I don't feel anything at all. The only reason why I study or do any work is to get high marks. That's it. Very recently (last month or two), I have been even slacking off in the study part. I have also started smoking cigarettes and doing marijuana edibles every other day.

Every day, I wake up at 10 already tired and swearing about everything (in my mind, I live at my parent's home rn). I attend a few zoom group project meetings, staying silent mostly and trying to look like I did the minimal amount of work to not get thrown out of the group. Then I try to feel better, make a huge list of assignments coming up and write down how much is each of them worth. I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that it's already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two (my friend doesn't smoke). While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible (legal), eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents won't know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 2-3 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep. Then, I wake up next day exhausted at 10 and the cycle goes on.

I also feel pretty dumb as I have almost no progress on my thesis. My professor thinks that I am smart but I am not. I just slack and slack and come up with some excuse for not doing the work. I just make some dumb and vague presentations an hour before the meeting. From last two weeks, I haven't even done that. I just make some excuse and try to portray myself as the victim. I have one more semester left for my thesis and I think I should just quit. But I can't because then how will I pay for my loan. I am also not getting any internships, how the fuck am I supposed to get a job. I thought maybe I'll start a PhD degree as I am not really getting anything else and I'll at least get some stipend regularly if I get the scholarship. My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now. I have to submit a draft of a literature review on Monday (rn it's Saturday night) which will be of around 15 pages and I haven't even started yet. I don't think I can do it and I don't think I deserve all this.

Oh also, if you haven't guessed it yet, no I have no friends. The friend I go out every evening is a very old friend who is probably the only person I talk to. He is a good person, I have tried telling him my situation but I don't think he understands it and I don't blame him. He has a completely different life and we are two different people.

I also have suicidal thoughts but the only reason I avoid thinking about it in detail is that if I die, my student loan will fall on my parents and that is just awful of me to that to them. I feel my existence is totally useless and I will bring nothing but misery to this universe. I don't think there is any point in living. I won't even get a job overseas. I will probably just get a mediocre job in India which will pay me average salary through which I will never be able to pay my loan. Probably will die with a debt on my head.

Old classmates from the college I left (IIT) have amazing jobs and I see most of them travelling and enjoying their life in beaches and clubs and whatnot. I know I shouldn't compare but in reality, I do. I just feel that I was that dumb guy who left such a college to get into this huge pile of shit. I wasn't happy there but am I happy now? Life is just a grind and the sooner I understand it, the better it will be for me. I don't have any hobbies except watching Youtube and masturbating and doing drugs.

Anything I can do? Is it possible for me to get out of the hole I dug myself for? Is there any hope for me? Is there anyone who can relate to my situation because I don't know anybody who can?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: An international student in an Australian uni studying online from my home country (India) from last one and half years. Living with my parents, smoking and doing marijuana edibles (legal) regularly. In my last year doing bachelor's honours thesis and continuously slacking in everything. No success in internship/job applications and feeling extremely stressed about repaying the loan (to the point of suicide). No social life and my family is too conservative to understand a single line of this post. Looking for some direction, someone who can relate to anything in this post or just in general help.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously a throwaway account, I doubt that anyone can identify me but if you do pls don't text me about it, it's just gonna make me feel worse. Also, I forgot to mention, Coming from a conservative lower-middle class family in India, I can't afford actual therapy plus considering my conservative environment, I can't really talk about this with anyone.

Text: Trigger warning (NSFW) : there will be mentions of self harm

Before anyone jumps to any conclusions please know I love my mother. She's has an interesting way of handling situations. She just wants best for me and everyone and doesn't know how to handle certain situations. 

I think the beginning was 7th grade. It's the age when I'm told kids around my age go through their adolescent stage. They become defiant of their parents and so forth. I'm not sure if this is applicable for everyone but I was one of the kids who defied their parents and acted like a brat. I'm certain from grade 7 it was just my teenage phase but now I'm not sure because at grade 8 and 9 these mood swings got progressively worse and I began to act more sad than just moody. 

In grade 9 I ended up going to the office to have a talk with the counselor. Don't shame me for this but I had just began to use social media and my account was small so only my friends knew my account. Maybe it was for the better but I had posted on my story that I was going to c*t myself for everyone friend of mine. (During this time my family was in the rough. My parents were talking about divorce because they were living apart for too long and their gears just didn't click well together after being apart for too long and just recently getting to live with each other.) I don't know what had gotten to me (because I probably shouldn't have posted such a sensitive topic) but I posted it but didn't completely follow through with it. I did very minor scratches. Maybe I was seeking comfort and attention. Anyways, I had posted it, this concerned my friends and it went all the way to the schools counselor and I ended up having a talk. 

I just bawled during the counsel meeting and asked if this would get to my parents and the counselor said yes. I didn't want to let my parents know because it would simply add fuel into the fire with my parents constantly talking about divorce. Anyways long story short this got to my parents and things got just a bit messier. My parents fought and mentioned my "problems" and blamed one another and it was difficult. 

(For those curious my parents didn't divorce they apologized with each other and made up)

After I had arrived home from the counsel meeting I had a talk with both my parents. It was funny because my dad asked me if he could see the c*ts and told me he used to have depression like me and told me he understood. My mom on the other hand was informed by the counselor I was recommended to see a therapist and my mom said, her words: "teens hitting their puberty stage". The counselor once again pushed the idea of meeting a counselor and had a small heated debate with my mom about it. My mom backed off and said she would meet one and left with me. We got in the car and the first thing my mom mentioned was that I wasn't going to see a therapist. She said a bunch of things about being upset she didn't know I was going through this and thought it was just me being pubescent but ultimately she was telling me she didn't believe in mental issues. 

She told me I wasn't depressed and that I was just pubescent. Grade 9 and 10 ended relatively smoothly with no self harming just minor break downs and uncontrollable mood swings. Grade 11 came and my previously clean record had relapsed. To this day despite having recently graduated I still unfortunately self harm as a way to cope from unstable emotions. 

The counselor told me I was depressed and have anxiety and others who listened to my rants and stories have told me similar to what the counselor said. 

I'm not sure what to do seeing I have doubts that I have depression because I'm comparing my issues to others and I currently don't understand myself with constant emotional numbness and random attacks of sadness. 

I wish to seek therapy but can't without my parents approval. My mother still doesn't believe in mental disorders and issues and I can't talk to her about these issues because she will take them as me talking back to her. 

I can't talk to my dad either because he will end up talking to my mom about it. 

Should I talk to my mother about my depression, self harm and seek therapy? If so how should I approach my mother without her telling me I'm just going through my pubescent stages (still) and making up a story. 

Sorry if this story sounds dumb.

Text: I realized the other day that I had my first burn out at 22. Now I am 32 and going through another, plus a few in between. 

I got a call from work today and there was a complaint put against me because of my "bad attitude" at work. This is because I get anxious around people and I get aggressive as a defense mechanism. It's either that or I start crying. Well actually sometimes it is both. 

I feel like whatever I do, it is never good enough. I feel like I have fucked up my life so bad, who knows if I will be able to recuperate. I don't have friends, the only person I speak with is my mother, I live alone, work sucks, not implicated with anything because I can't keep a commitment. I just feel really lost. All I can think of is all the things I thought I would be by now. I figured that I would have some sort of career figured out, maybe own my place or have some saving, some friends or maybe a family. But I have none of that and with every passing day it feels like it is getting farther and farther away. I just feel like I can't get traction, I try different techniques but can't seem to put anything in place. 

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what I am going to do. There is a good chance that I have come into contact with the virus and almost hope I die, then I wouldn't have to deal with this shit. 

I guess what I am really asking is: How do I, after 10+ years of unstable mental health, get my life back together and on some sort of track in the right direction?

Text: I have had depression for 18 years now. And I seem to go back and fourth between being somewhat normal and happy to just completely depressed to the point of no energy and suicidal thoughts. Well im back to that no energy and suicidal thoughts but ive also been oversleeping. I will quite literally wake up for work as late as possible then come home and go directly to bed again. This has been happening for the past 4 days now. Yes I am on meds and yes I see a therapist but next session isnt until the 15th.  What are ways I can avoid oversleeping and get out of this funk? 

Possible causes to this depressive episode: anniversary of my grandma's death. It was recently my birthday and i would only celebrate it with my grandma. Increased rumification. Been eating junk food for the past week.

Text: Hello redditors!
(Throwaway Account)

I've been depressed for several years now and because I have a hard time feeling any emotions at all I just pretend to and play along for the majority. I am not actively suicidal anymore but I still think about it daily and I cannot shake the automatic "... guess I can always kill myself". 

Only my best friend who is in a similar state of mind knows how I feel and the rest of my friends and family have no idea and I don't want to tell them for several reasons. 

I live with my SO and we have been living together for 2 years now. I think she knows that I am "feeling blue" a lot but I am certain she doesn't know how severe it is. 

Recently I have been thinking about how I could start a conversation if I chose to do so but I don't know how because she is emotionally unstable sometimes (but not clinically depressed and only short periods of time). 

I am afraid that confiding in people will only make my living situation worse without actually helping my state of mind. 

I don't know what responses this may get but thanks anyways. 

I know this sounds like a douche thing to say and I appreciate the good intentions but please spare me the "hang in there"

I just feel so damn lonely. I'm broke, depressed, and my life isn't going anywhere. Why is everything so hard?

I'm trying to escape the rut I'm in but it's an uphill battle. It's hard   for me to hold down a consistent job, still be creative and productive, and not want to yeet myself every day. I just don't get it...maybe I  hit  the Unlucky Lottery?

There's a   part of me that just gets sadder when I see posts from my friends   showing off their engagement rings or the places they've traveled. I'm   not supposed to feel that way so I try to ignore it, but the emotion   becomes so overwhelming that I can no longer ignore it. I'm supposed to be happy for them. I should stop wallowing in pity. An unspoken pitfall of depression is that you can become quite self-absorbed.

I'd love to be in a relationship, but not many people want to date the  mentally ill guy--which I guess is reasonable. Another shitty thing is  that my religion teaches you're not even allowed to *think* about sex before marriage, which makes my life so much harder now that I associate every urge I have with guilt.

What am I to do? Just continue suffering without any hope of a better life? Why?

Fuck me, man.

Text: New here, I don’t know if this would fit in or belong. But I am struggling with my relationship with my girlfriend. She hates her job, constantly stressed out and while I’m at work she will call and rant and often cry. I listen and try to help but feel like I am of no help. Everyday as soon as I get off of work I go to her house and just sit and try to help. She lays in bed from the time she gets home and constantly says she is miserable. She constantly says she wants to go to sleep and not wake up. She says it is not worth living anymore. She is seeing a therapist but I feel like I can’t leave her alone for more than an hour with risk of her hurting herself. I just need some advice of what to do in my situation. Thank you in advance.

Text: I felt that for a couple months things were going well and I was finally on track to getting my life together. this pandemic has kind of uprooted everything and I feel super isolated and demotivated again. I can’t get myself out of bed most days let alone study for my degree (im a med student), exercise or eat. The main thing is I just think about how much of a failure I am, how everyone hates me and how worthless I am. Anyone got experience with getting themselves out of a rut like this/currently feeling the same?

Text: I have a lot of deadlines coming up this week which have made me anxious every day for almost 2 weeks now. The anxiety has made my physical illness flair up to the point where I have to miss school, I can’t eat, sleep, or be productive. I’m so so sad because of this. It happened all at once and I don’t know how to manage it. I’ve been crying almost every day because I miss when I felt better. The physical illness is new (diagnosed in March) and it’s extremely overwhelming. It makes me feel hopeless every day. Some people get better and some people get worse. Idk if I believe I can get better, but I want to. It’s just so hard for me to envision living the rest of my life suffering like this. My therapist who I’ve been seeing for 2 years is now taking 6 months off. I’ve tried to find a new therapist but they either aren’t taking new patients or don’t even respond to my phone calls. I’m so lost. I don’t know what to do.

Text: I don't even know how to stat this tbh i dont even remember how it feels to ve happy, im just sad all the time and nobody wants to listen to me. All i cand to is to think that it will be better if i just kill myself but i cant do it cause im thinking what it my mom or dad cry... I am not the same person... And it was getting better with the help of this girl, damn i love her so much, we used to talk daily for a lot of time, she knows everything about me, she even said se loves me one time, but she just become cold with me and moved on to a better guy and just forgot about me, the bad thing is that i cand forget her, i think she is the love of my live and i will never get over her... She is happy now and im glad she is  but for me it is getting just worse by the day. Now i stay in my room, cry all day listening to music and imaging that we are tougher even i know it will never happen. I cant even be mad at her because i understand why she didn't want me that way, i mean i wold do the same in her place... It feels so weird knowing that i will nwver get her or get over her...i just cant wait for the moment i die because i can't live like this, everything reminds me of her...

Text: Hello (Lengthy post, so I'm sorry in advance if I waste your time),

I am diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, however I believe it doesn't affect my day to day life enough to claim anything because other's have it worse (and most likely would be a waste on me anyway).

When I'm a member of a team, I feel too insignificant in comparison to colleagues/team mates to ever say or put in any input. I have explained to others that I see it as:

If I have to work really hard to keep the job, and they can chill / lounge around and still keep the job that's equal to mine, they must have more value than me, therefore I have to try harder and respect them as my superior.

My managers and colleagues say I'm too much and "old"-friends have ended friendships due to me being "too nice".

At parties and gatherings, I decide to stay quiet because I believe I'll ruin the entire night and I find it easier to seek out those that aren't enjoying themselves to then go over, give them a bit of social motivation, make myself a laughing stock for them to laugh with their new friends and allow them to enjoy the night from then on without me intefering and potentially making it worse.

I have been told all my life I am too much, or just "too" something, but it's more of an insult now, even if it is said with positive intention. I just want to be "enough". Nothing more, nothing less.

This has come around due to my mother saying I would have done so much better in my life if I didn't focus on helping others so much, but I didn't even realise I was focusing. She tells me I'm "too nice" about once a month.

After talking to my current SO, she says it is depression.

Thank you for your time, and sorry for wasting time if you read this and don't know how to help,

Text: Hey girls and guys,

I'm suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 15 years old. Today I'm 21. My symptoms are mainly anhedonia (disinterest and joylessness), lack of drive, motivation and ability to get stimulated, painful negative thoughts starting right in the morning when I open my eyes (about past, present, future, that I don't have anything to offer, that I'm disabled, that future life has nothing to offer for me etc.), lethargy, low mood, sadness, cognitive restrictions (memory, focus, access to knowledge and thoughts) and irrational social anxiety.

I wake up and see nothing that waits on me, nothing that I wait for or am up to or interested in, no drive or motivation to stand up, nothing that drives me (anhedonia again). I then think what reasons or motives do other "normal" people see when waking up? I feel so empty about what the day has for me. Only thing I can see is food, maybe. Even food is no drive for me, I don't eat that much and don't feel the need to eat, I suffer from lack of appetite due to depression.

Sure, I don't have much self worth or confidence at all. I don't have many things I'm passionate about or I'm good in. I see the connection: no things you're passionate (drive) or good at (feelings of success giving self worth) =&gt; depression. I still do things. I have a side job, not quite good in it. I study psychology, 5th semestre already, not quite good in it. As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think I'm dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such. Studying and university tasks or contents are very hard for me. I play tennis but rarely, quite good in it. I used to go to the gym, was boring but still quite good for distraction and feelings of success. I produce digital music, quite good in it and makes fun when I have a good day. I would love to play tennis and visit the gym more often but 1. they all contain socializing as there are people, so my social anxiety makes it incredibly hard for me and 2. now there is Corona. Other things like academic aspects, going deeper into a topic, studying neuro science or pharmacology (esp. neuroscience was a love of mine, I spent a lot of time with it and it was the reason for me starting the bachelor in psychology) is almost impossible for me because depression makes me dumb, disabled and very restricted in thinking or making.

I'm sorry for the long text. Thanks to everyone who read until here. What are your thoughts?

Do you have experience with this and somehow managed to improve the situation and feelings?

Do you have ideas for projects or hobbies I could try to get into and maybe find a passion in to kill my feelings of emptiness, negative thoughts and self worth issues? I would be happy about any idea, anything, that's somehow manageable even when being depressed and socially anxious. Something I can hold onto, improve in and get feelings of success and self worth or skill. Something that distracts me from negative thoughts and psychological pain of depression.

Have a nice day, I wish you the best! &lt;3

Text: I have been on Citalopram for five weeks. The first three weeks I was on 10mg, the last two weeks I've been on 20mg. On 10mg, I felt tired in the morning, but it got better throughout the day. This lasted for the first week, then I stopped experiencing fatigue. Since switching to 20mg, I've been feeling even worse fatigue that barely gets better throughout the day. When can I expect this fatigue to start improving? Has anyone had luck switching to taking Citalopram in the evening? I'm currently taking it in the morning...

Spring break is coming up in a week. Would it be worth it to wait it out and see if the fatigue goes away, or should I use that time to start a different AD? I've heard that Citalopram can be a sedating AD. Does that mean the fatigue will probably never go away?

Text: It's been four months since I turned eighteen and everything seems to be a mess for me. My depression is severe and it's getting the best out of me, my anxiety is consuming me and it hurts me badly. My ptsd (long story) really gets me to have these attacks where I'm not myself and I just experience more pain.

I've tried counseling for years, I've had depression ever since I was eleven and my mother passed away the day after mothers day. I've talked to my boyfriend a lot about my issues and my feelings and I really don't want him to have to carry more and have more on his plate. I really love him.. I want to be able to support myself and try to find something that can help me get through the day.

So, my question is, what helps you get through the day? What thoughts do you think that help you get through it all? Coping strategies? (I play a lot of  video games but sometimes it's just not enough for me) Is there any way to express your feelings more appropriately and not have everything just overwhelm you and you explode?

I know not everyone is the same, and that many answers will vary, but I'm trying to get out of my old habits and I just need some help and support. *I want to better myself, and I don't exactly know how to.*

Text: I’ve been dealing with depression for a long time, several years. I only recently started trying to fix it and started taking some meds which I’ve been on for about 3.5 months now. What’s the point of it all? I come home from work now and for no reason just feel totally useless and like I don’t matter. At least before the meds I was numb and didn’t feel this way. I’m finding myself almost in tears at work, for no reason at all. Earlier this week I came home, sat down on my couch and just started to cry. All week I've had 0 motivation to do anything. I still ended up going to the gym for a couple yoga classes hoping it would at least make me feel a bit better, it didn't. I just want to know if this will ever get better? Will I ever feel useful/wanted? Will I ever genuinely be happy? I'm so tired of being tired and sad.

Text: Last year I went to the doctor and told him I was feeling down but I just couldn't get myself to say depression for some reason. It felt too real and obviously he belleved nothing I said and told me the basics- eat properly, sleep, excercise. I thought I'm never going to talk to anyone ever about it again 

Now I keep having thoughts and I am honestly scared I will do something.. I have no one to turn to. No one would believe me because on the surface I have everything going for me how could I ever be depressed. I told my parents they didn't believe it and told me I am just stressed/its a phase

Text: So I have been depressed for years now. I'm 14 years old. I know that therapy is a thing I should get but I can't. I already have 3 siblings in therapy and my parents don't need another. Plus this whole covid 19 stuff. Anyway even after i can't go to my family about it because they are already stressed all the time and I can't add to it all. Plus I have a hard time talking about all my problems to other people. So I came here to ask for suggestions on what I can do for the time being to help me feel better about myself until I am able to get help. I hope I'm not asking too much. Thanks in advance for any suggestion.

Hey guys,

so i was "daiting" with a girl and after trying and trying she couldnt get any feelings for me.

We got into a big conversation about it after 2 months. She never told anybody and never ever talked about it with somebody. She told me that she is Depressed. I asked for some reasons and when it started. She told me that it started in high school because her parents have really high hopes in her and pressuring her pretty much. She is 19 now. I feel like (she told me as well) the reason why she can't love me is because of her depression. I told her that im ready to help her anytime and all. But she doesnt want help and really doesnt like it when others help her. She doesnt cry infront of anyone because thats a symbole of weakness she tells me. I really care about her. It even feels like it hurts me more then her to a point. I dont know what to do. And i feel like if i will be there for her that one day she might feel how it is to love somebody. Since she told me that she never loved someone really. So if anyone could give me a tip on how to handle the situation that would be the greatest thing ever.

I also asked her this question on a scale to 0-10 if 0 is: that she loves her life and most things are going well and 10 is: i want to kill myself as soon as possible. She answered 8. I'm really concerned. And getting a therapist isn't an option as well for her. She would never take any pills either or so. She isnt Religious, she feels the "best" if she is just alone and if she has her quietness. She feels pressured if she is outside with her friends etc.. She also doesn't find relationships appealing. Maybe because she never had a good/real one with feelings but that is just an assumption. She has guilty feelings because she started daiting me and wishes me to find a better one. She doesnt really like herself etc etc. Dont understand me wrong. Outside she is a extrovert, like nobody would know that she is actually depressed im sure. She acts like a woman that is really happy with most things. But some sings i could read told me how she things about certain themes..

Please i beg you guys please help me to find a way to help her. Thats the only thing that would make me happy. I would give everything for her to slowly feel "normal" again. I want to be her saviour/hero :(..

sorry for my bad english ):

Text: When I was a teenager from maybe 14/15 years old onwards I struggled with poor self-esteem, low mood, lack of motivation, procrastination, guilt, insomnia and anxiety (about school work, my health and social situations). Back then I did a lot of wallowing and was pretty "woe is me". I didn't really have many hobbies or friends and spent a lot of time on the internet.

I'm 27 now and I've worked hard to get better at coping with things but I still find myself falling into the same patterns (though with a little less melodrama I like to think!).

Last year I got CBT for health anxiety and I found that really helpful. This isn't the first time I'd spoken to a doctor about my mental health but it's the first time I'd gotten treatment. What kind of surprised me though was one of the questionnaires I completed indicated I might have mild depression. This wasn't something we discussed and I'm left wondering now does that mean it's no big deal? 

I find my job pretty difficult because I'm constantly battling feelings of inadequacy, guilt, anxiety, low motivation and procrastination. It feels like *I* must be the problem as I felt similarly about my previous jobs as well.

So I'm just hoping there might be something I can do to overcome this? Has anyone dealt with something similar? I know my problems aren't that acute or severe but they are persistent and have a cumulatively really detrimental effect on my life.

Text: I am a 13 depressed and suicidal kid. I have been like this since the age of 11.i have no enjoyment for life whatsoever. My parents are strict so they want me to be at the top of my class. But since I've fallen in this state, my grades have started to slip. My parents got really mad at me and made me work even harder. But it's hard. I have zero motivation. I have failed. As a child, as a friend, as a student, as a person. I am too scared to tell my mom. I told my dad. He seemed to care for a week. Then he shomed no empathy. Back to a strict parent. My mom says depression isn't real. I haven't told her. I just heard her while she was talking to her friend. They expect me to study 14 hrs a day and only play for 2 hrs on Sundays. I am hopeless. I am deciding if I should end it all or not

Text: So to keep this short i am a 32 year old who has spent pretty much his whole life in school. I've tried really hard and have not accomplished much of anything in my life . Unimportant job, no love life (I'm really fat and ugly...not because I didn't try but because I take a lot of psych meds that fuck with my weight), don't make a lot of money, i still live with my folks (pathetic).  What things should I focus on to counteract all the loserness that I am composed of? More money? Lose a ton of weight? I just want to know if I should even bother sticking around... I know the closest thing to love I'm going to get is being a woman's safety school and then being punished for not being a good enough package. People who look like me aren't anyone's fantasy.

Text: I don’t understand myself right now. I shouldn’t be feeling this way but right now I’ve been miserable for months. I’ve got a new, high paying job. My husband is loving and supportive and my family is loving as well. But I’m here at 2 in the morning sobbing again alone. I don’t do anything outside of work right now and my job feels miserable. I don’t feel like I’m cut out for it and I dread waking up in the morning. I don’t have the emotional energy to do anything else outside of work. Even scrolling through the internet can’t really keep my Interest anymore. It’s hard to focus on anything right now. I find myself unable to keep up with things and it always feels like I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop of my next fuck up. My leader is coaching me on the same things every week. 

At work I find myself anxious with certain tasks for no real reason. I don’t like talking to people but that’s what I have to do all day and I’m growing to despise it. I feel like I’m not leading my team and I’m leaving them twisting in the wind. I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing and I want to quit but I can’t do that. 

I try not to be so negative and get out of my own head but I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the energy right now for a hobby. I’m barley eating these days, I can’t sleep and I’m taking 2-3 anxiety showers a day now. 

How do I get over this? I don’t understand myself. I should be sad all the time. Things are fine. And yet I’m in my own way right now and I feel like I’m letting depression ruin my life for no real reason. I don’t know. I just want to disappear right now. I find myself wishing I was sick or something just to be able to go away for a while. I don’t want to be here

Text: So my partner has been dealing with sadness and suicidle thoughts all their entire life its so extremely hard to help them i do help every time we are together its perfect absolutely perfect for both of us i am everything to them and i help as much as i possibly can but theres only so much i can do as we arent together every single minute. they have been hurt by their previous partner and emotional damage from their moms emotional and physical abuse in the past ranging from brith i think until her 5th grade year thats when the physical abuse (slapping cornering shoving head under bathtub water pushing into walls) but the emotional abuse has continued until this year about a few months ago their mom has been very extremely nice to her randomly for no reason. My partners depression gets extremely bad she is constantly sad and frequently has suicidle thoughts and gets very overwhelmed with her home life has asthma attacks and panic attacks for apparently no reason. I am running out of ideas i have done everything for her and i am continuing to do so but my mental illnesses sometimes makes it almost impossible to help and vise versa. She had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away. 
Please help me find ways to help them cope for the 3 more years they have in their house and how to help her get from the ground up as i have to do this 5/7 days now.

Text: I(23m) lost my dad to covid-19 at the start of this year. I woke up and realized what day it is and just started sobbing. My partner(25f) lost her dad at a young age and has numbed herself to cope as his passing played a huge part in the path her life took, but this is still fresh for me. It's the first Father's Day without him. I asked for some support from her and her responses were very cold. "You can't let today hurt you like this." "I just ignore this day, you gotta just stay off your phone." "You can't cry all day about this." 

I get that she's had time to cope with this trauma, and her responses are partly to protect herself from her feelings about her own dad she's been dealing with for years, but fuck. I needed support, just some time to let it out and confront my feelings, and after the way she responded I'm no longer sure how I feel about this woman. What would you do?

I try really hard to be understanding of others feelings, and especially compassionate of my partners feelings. But I honestly don't know if I can be with someone who would invalidate my feelings like that, even with their own trauma. She came to apologize and acknowledge that she was being inconsiderate, but that hurt me so much I don't even want to look at her right now.

I don't know. I love this woman, and I'm incredibly patient with partners. Her responses show a fundamental lack of compassion that I can't teach, but her apology shows an understanding of her fuck up and an attempt to right it, so I don't know what to do about it. Maybe after I take some time to cool off we can talk about it and gain better understanding.

For anyone else hurting today, I'm so sorry, just remember our fathers are out there somewhere, having a big cookout in the sky, fighting over Grill Master and looking down pridefully at the amazing children they made.

Text: I’m not going to type much here but it’d be great if I wasn’t a sad fucking mess that does nothing in their life. a few months ago I’ve been diagnosed with depression and I’m just never in the mood to do anything. I’m always tired and I always think about ending it all. To be honest I have a pretty shitty life and at this point I think my parents don’t believe in mental health. At least I have one friend that is really helping with all of this mumbo jumbo. She always makes my day at least ten times better. I am really needing help because I don’t want anything worse than this happening. Every day I feel horrible to wake up, and the whole day I’m just stressing on some random things. I don’t want to be miserable every day :( this is not how I want to live. Someone please help me.

Text: I haven't been able to see a doctor, or a professional who can diagnose and help me, I haven't been able to get up the courage to talk about this with anyone.

I remember there were nights when I would stay up crying until dawn, where I just wanted to die, where I just wanted to end this pain that I didn't understand where it was coming from.

This year there were people who helped me, I was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life. And thanks to them I was able to help many people in need, especially many children, to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time, to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year, I honestly did not think I would make it to the end of the year.

My parents don't know, I have to be strong because we have been in a very bad economic situation and I have had to be the man of the house. My younger brother tries very hard, he is working very hard on a sports project, where he has to be concentrated and training seven days a week, and he has me as his anchor, so I always have to be strong for him.

I've been holding on, looking for ways to escape from this, there were moments where I was able to escape although I really don't know how long I managed to avoid it, there are songs that calm me down and make me stop thinking for a while, they make me feel like I'm getting out of my head and going to other places, The song "Don't you worry child" has been one of those, the chorus that says "Don't you worry, don't you worry child see heavens got a plan for you" has been like a kind of anchor, but every day I feel it working less, the unexplainable pain is coming back out of nowhere.

I don't know what to do, I'd like to have someone to go to, I'm alone and I have no one to seek refuge in. I had been able to keep it away, but it has caught up with me again, this feeling of 

I'm afraid of falling back into the hole and spending every night crying and with that feeling that's like being stabbed in the chest or could get worse, I'm lost.

I just want to have a normal life, I don't want this feeling, I don't want this pain, I don't want to be lost anymore, I need to scape from this.

Text: I've been having a pretty rough two or three months. This means even that I feel uncomfortable having my boyfriend touching me. I have talked to him about this twice how I've been growing distant and disliking anything to do with touching (he is a person who loves touch). It seems like even though I've told him how bad it feels having someone touching me, he keeps doing it and it is starting to suffocate me. He is always asking why I don't touch him and stopping me to hug me or touch me in some way. This is making me quite irritable as well. I am waiting to get help from a doctor and see what I can do about it, but can you guys give me some advice on this? How can I get myself to not feel this way? I've been forcing myself to take it for a while now and it just gets worse?

Text: I (16m) have depression and can't really manage a relationship or strong romantic attractions anymore. Like any other 16 year old guy I want to have sex, but I don't want to just do a hook up or a one time thing with someone who doesn't mean anything to me. I really only want to have sex with someone I'm really emotionally attached too, and I also want my first time to be with someone else who hasn't done it yet. I kinda just assumed that sex would come in it's own time until I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago, where now I'm being told that I should avoid relationships for the sake of my mental health. She was also the one who demeaned me for not having had sex before and sorta the reason I need it to be someone else's first time too. She basically made fun of me for not having had sex before, and I never really cared about losing my v-card, but now I'm thinking about how belittled I feel knowing that I haven't had sex whereas many of my friends have and now I notice all of them sorta expect me to have it as well, and even though I want it to be special and real they still see me differently for not having had it (some context-my friends are also fucking nerds and it is beyond me how any of them have had sex yet). I guess I'm looking for advice or consolidation, but I just don't really know what to do

Text: for context, my boyfriend and I are in an ldr for over 1.5 years now. he's from japan and i'm from america. depression/mental illness are very much taboo, as is even things like therapy, in japan. it's just not something that's socially acceptable to even talk about there, so i can't imagine how hard it must be for him now.

we've never had any major fights/disagreements until this "confrontation" happened on thanksgiving day. he has been studying abroad in europe for the semester, and it's definitely taken a toll on him-- he knows and admits that this is one of the major reasons he is feeling the way he is now. he's homesick, doesn't have any close friends, and has recently found out one of his best friends from high school is addicted to drugs. overall.... it's been a really crazy semester for him, and lots of shitty things happening in my personal life as well. it's just not a good year for either of us, but our relationship has been really strong. 

i had just booked a non-refundable flight to visit him for christmas, my birthday, and through to new years. i noticed that, compared to when we discussed this visit during our last time together (\~1st week of november), he was significantly less excited. i knew something was off, but he wouldn't say. this weird vibe kept persisting through the week, and on thanksgiving night, i asked him what was wrong. he finally admitted to me (paraphrasing):

"i don't think i can love you anymore. not because i love someone else or lost interest in you, but i'm feeling really depressed recently, and i can't enjoy things. i can't even be excited for your visit. now, i'm just needing a break. I’m not saying I wanna cut you off completely, but at this moment idk how to even talk to you. what I’m doing is not giving up, but cleaning myself up. i just need time." he keeps saying things like this, which is hard for me to accept because I know what it's like to be depressed. he is pushing me away and hiding this part of himself from me, and I just want nothing more than to support him and be there for him-- which made me feel like my visit was even more urgent.

he kept saying things like how he would feel sorry for me if i tried to stay by his side and support him, and how he doesn't want to burden me with his problems or ruin my bday/christmas/new years by making me sad. he even said, verbatim "The more you care about me, the more I feel bad for you, regardless of what you’re saying. I might change my mind later but for now I can’t. When I see you care about me, I get hurt." he even offered to pay for my flight because I "shouldn't just come there to take care of someone who's full of shit" since I can't get a refund, but I refused. 

It's been about two days, and at the end of our messaging and phone calls, I told him that I am still going to catch that flight, and that I'll give him the space he's asking for, but that I'm here whenever he needs me. 

sorry if it's hard to read, and no tl;dr because I think it's important to know everything that I wrote above before saying anything...

I'm just really desperate to talk to someone about this, and I really do need advice/support. 

How can I support him, aside from giving him space? Should I wait for him to reach out to me on his own terms, even if it means not seeing him at all for the 2 weeks I'm in the same city as him? How do I keep him from drifting away or getting worse, even with the distance?

Text: Hello, this is a throwaway account. I am female, 21 and was diagnosed with severe depression and a bipolar personality disorder.

I’ve been feeling depressed for 7 years now and last year I finally found myself strong enough to see a doctor and since then I’ve been trying to get therapy but it’s basically impossible since I don’t have private insurance. I am on plenty of waiting lists but I’ve not yet gotten one call back. I am scared that at some point it will be too late because I’m gone.

I want therapy so badly. I need it.

I am not able to live a normal life at all, everything weights me down no matter how small the issue is. It affects my daily life way too much.

When I start panicking, starting to cry, scream, hurt myself, I want to have myself locked up, so someone can look over me, give me medication, etc.
I really want that but the thought of it scares me insanely much.

Right now, the only thing bringing me joy is spending time with my boyfriend online. We’ve been together for a year now and it couldn’t be more perfect, except my disorder ruining a lot of things. I play games with him online, we have so much fun. I don’t want to lose that. Additionally I am studying and I’d be done next year and graduate. However without some kind of help I know I won’t be able to do it. I already had to repeat a whole year because of my issues.

I don’t know what to do. I really want to be somewhere where I am being watched so I can get help anytime I need it. But I have so much to lose. My partner, my dog, my computer, what if they even take my phone?

I started writing this to calm down from another panic attack over something super small and it helped me calm down but I rarely have something to make me calm again so all I usually do is scream and cry and hurt myself for two hours till my body is too tired to even stay awake so I basically just pass out...

I need advice, support, anything I just need to talk about this

Text:        Hi! This is my first time talking about my problems online so I will write a lot. If you stay to read everything, thank you, I appreciate it, because I really need it.
       So, I am almost 17 and I have depression since back in secondary school. I am always isolated by my colleagues, who only use me when they need to. Even so, I am always there for them although not the other way around. In my country being selfish is in power, but my parents raised me to be kind and modest so its pretty hard for me to find any friend. Besides that, my parents treat me very badly, always yelling at me or punishing me out of nothing, sometimes pretending I don't even exist. They don't believe me even if I tell the truth and don't ever encourage me. Because of that i became shy and introverted. 
      The only friend I had , who started talking to me two years ago, becaming my bestfriend and also my first love later, changed completely when she got into highschool, got a boyfriend and threw me aside even if I told her about my depression and she knew I really needed her. Now I am alone and I got used to it, but I need someone be there for me and my loneliness only makes me feel more depressed.
      I always avoid going out with my parents because I feel like shit with them but I hate myself for it and their disappointed looks break my heart. The only way to escape from reality is my phone, but I started using it too often, watching night after night anime even if I have severe myopia. I constantly feel tired, I have no motivation to do anything, I don't seem to be able to love someone anymore and I really can't see myself in the future. The reason I write this is because today I had a nightmare with that girl and when I woke up my chest was hurting so bad and I screwed up with my parents.
     If anyone has come so far, thanks again, and sorry about my bad English. I really need some advice : What should i do? How can I escape this?

Text: My (30 f) ex boyfriend (34) ended things from depression at the beginning of the shut down from covid. He told me he didnt love me anymore almost 3 weeks ago.  I dont know if this is how he really feels or if it's the depression closing him off to feeling anything. I haven't spoken to him since he told me. But I go back and read older messages leading up to the break up and I see him telling me he's struggling with the depression but he tells me how happy I make him and how much he loves me and I keep him afloat. But once he hit a really bad rough patch he closed me out completely. Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lasted/or while you or they got help? I believe in my heart he does love me and the depression suppressed those feelings. You dont just have those feelings disappear from a happy relationship without some type of issue going on. I've been dying to reach out to him but I was the one that said I needed to heal, but with the riots going on and him being a firefighter and his mother telling me he said the therapist is getting him to open up I want to reach out so bad. Can yall share your stories and give me any insight on his possible feelings or what people did in my own personal shoes? :/ He is the love of my life and losing him has been the hardest thing I've ever experienced.  He also has never dealt with depression before so it's entirely new for him. Thank you for anyone and everyone that can help or atleast share their own experiences.

Text: I’ve never felt so alone and I’m ashamed to have close to no social life. My friends removed me from the group because my social anxiety became a burden and my family has their own social life. I’m a burden to everyone around me and I’m a pathetic loser who has nothing to do and I’m just done. I’m so tired of feeling this way and hating myself. I’m finally at the point where I don’t think I’d hurt anyone if I left. I guess I’m just posting this for closure, but if anyone could provide a reason to stay I’m open to listening. I’m a piece of shit human clearly so it might be a waste of breath

Text: Hi. I wanted to reach out. To have a genuine interaction with another person. No pretenses or ulterior motives. Im on the balcony of a hotel in Thailand and looking out at that long drop, it just makes me wonder what if. I don't know if I've ever felt as lost as I do tonight.

In my cynicism I fear that people don't actually genuinely care(for others, me included), and why would they eh? Does that kind of warmth and love exist in the world outside of fairytales and movies? I have these doubts so I really don't reach out usually, even to the people I surround myself with. But right now maybe Im chasing rainbows again, but I'd like some genuine communication, even if it's on the internet and under the mask of anonymity. If anyone would care. If you would take the time to hear me.

I'm 22. I live in South Korea and I've been quite sad, depressed, since the 9th grade. It's been 8 years. I feel like I've lost a lot of what made me me in that time. I feel like an empty shell. All the color and life sucked out and nothing but an empty husk left. Yet despite all that I've lost, I believe I have much more to lose still, because I have despaired before, believing I've hit rock bottom. Then time would pass and I'd look back, only to realize how much I had back then.

When I first started to have depressing thoughts, self doubt, existential problems, I turned to my family for help. My mother, father and sister. Why? because they're my family, and I thought it would matter to them that I, their son, was suffering so genuinely, in so much pain and doubt. When I was so lost and confused and desperately reaching out to them, they fucking turned their back on me. Or so I felt, back then and I still do. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that I'd never share my life with them again. I acted out, maybe in an attempt to punish them, to get back at them for not caring. I just let myself go, let my life collapse little by little. Years have passed now and I honestly think I've never been able to really give up hope that my family would be there for me, as if they would just suddenly drop whatever they're doing and come to my side, telling me that they care and that we'll  make this right. Now, as much it pains me to acknowledge it, I don't  think that's  ever going to happen. I just attempted to talk to my mother for the first time in months about my depression and she immediately got up and left the room. I feel like I should be undamaged by this by now, and I want to tell myself I'm fine after that, but I feel so alone in this world and stupid for thinking that she'd care enough to want to listen. This is all the more crushing because we're  on a family trip which I did not want to come to initially, but after we got here, I felt things that I hadn't  felt for a long time, that I thought I'd never feel again. Something made me want to get my life together and do things. So in the process of thinking about what I'd like to do after this trip, the events I mentioned happened. I honestly feel very hopeless and my will to live has dwindled close to none. Should I just give up on my seemingly unrealistic dreams and expectations of a loving caring family and move on? It hurts my heart. so much. but seems like the only way to do anything with my life. Do I move on? for what? Myself? It just doesn't seem a good enough reason. I am not a good enough reason for me to continue living life. I don't care about myself enough. A life without love seems bleak, ugly and meaningless.

 I'm thinking of packing my bags and getting on a plane to like canada or australia to start a new life. With zero plans, it scares me so much, but I want to stop this endless ride downhill. Despite the despair in this post, what I really seek is a reason to continue and a way to do so. How do I move forward? Any thoughts or comments are ok

Text: Been at my job for about 2 years, have had a good handle on depression and suicidal ideation the entire time, however it has been an extremely difficult month for me. HR pulled me in today and asked what changed my attitude from being generally upbeat to "wearing a figurative Fuck Off Leave Me Alone sign on my forehead" this month. I told them I was struggling with some home issues and now they seem overly concerned that I'm not a good fit with the company. I don't think I'll lose my job but they seem to be harping on it alot. Do I just tell them straight up that I've been close to killing myself every night for the past month? Or do I lie and say it's something else?

Text: Basically, I feel like I'm doing "all the things" that someone with depression is supposed to do. 

I exercise, eat relatively healthily, maintain several close relationships with friends and family, take medication and vitamins, go to therapy, try to keep busy but not burn out... 

And I'm still stuck. There's no situational issues or any residual trauma that makes me feel this way. I've just always been depressed, which runs in my family. 

It makes me think of the quote, "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result." I feel like I'm just working WAY too hard to stay afloat, doing the same things every day and expecting that eventually I'll feel better. 

I don't want to give up. I'm NOT going to give up. I just feel crazy, I feel like all of my energy is going towards keeping myself alive, and I don't have any room to just BREATHE. 

I've had to leave work early or call in sick a few times in the last few weeks because I couldn't stop crying about nothing. I'm so stressed by just doing my basic daily routine that I have kind of a meltdown every night when I get home from work. My days off are equally difficult.

I try to do the things that I know bring me joy, even when I don't feel it. I'm just starting to feel a little bit insane expecting things to get better without some sort of change, and I feel that I'm running out of options for things to change or improve.

Text: And I can't do even that, since I seem to have crying block. That aside, I'm just really hopeless.

And the worst is, I don't even know why exactly I'm feeling like that at the moment. I feel really overwhelmed, like I can't wrap my head around it all. I'm lonely, I don't know what to do career wise, I'm tired. So fucking tired.

So I open up my laptop, and watch a movie, or series. And I feel even worse, cause I'd prefer their reality to mine. 

And I'm nothing like I wish I was,and I feel so often pretty much worthless because I'm not accomplished. 

And I wish I had some kind of purpose because it all feels so fucking aimless. I'm just tired.

Text: Idk where to start, I've always been quiet, that's just the way I am, but around the age of 11 my parents fought for custody, it didnt feel like they were fighting for me, they were fighting for my brothers, my parents never show they care for me, they're always focused on my brothers, and no one appreciates me, no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, no one notices me

I've always had a hard time making friends, but I moved right as quarantine started, I didnt know anyone, I was alone, I lost connection with my friends, except my for my long distance girlfriend, I gave her everything I ever had, all my money, my time, my energy, there wasnt a time where I wasn't there for her, I suppose I got too attached, but, I still made sure she was happy, I helped her with her anxiety/depression, I spent months convincing her parents to get her a therapist, helped her with every problem she had, big and small, got her presents, gave her confidence, and then with the long distance our relationship got rocky, with the isolation with only her to talk to, I got depressed, I talked to her, but she never cared, she never tried to make me fell better, she only cared how she felt, so I was confused how I felt, we went on and off from texting, and then one day her bff texted me how I was toxic, I probably was but didnt see it, but, it still hurt to hear that it was my fault, i only wanted her to be happy and all I got in return was a punch in the face, me and her dated for half a year and I knew her for 3, she was my everything, I didn't have a lot of friends so I gave her all my time, she put herself in front of me, and that what everyone else does, expects me to give them attention, all my life it has been like that, all I am to people is a outlet, if I killed myself no one would care. They would forget in a month, I just wish someone cared for me for onc

I need my confidence back, I need my happiness back, I dont even know who I am, I want help

Text: I'm depressed and my family knows this. I've been diagnosed and all that stuff.

Next week, I wanted to stay with a friend because the closest I get to feeling ok is when I am with them. It'd be nice to have a break from everything.

But they refuse to let me go until I talk to them.

But I have nothing to talk about. I have many, many reasons as to why I'm depressed and at the same time none at all. I don't want to talk to them about it. I'm getting a therapist soon and I've talked to my doctor a little already, but they can't seem to respect the fact I don't want to talk to them about it.

Please help me. 

What can I say to them to convince them? Is this normal? Do I really have to talk to them about it, even though I'm already getting help?

Text: I'm 24F. I'm sorry if my english it's bad, i speak spanish. I've always been a little sad, i mean, nothing to worry, i think, because i felt happy sometimes and used to enjoy things. I've always been too obsessed about the way i look, i think in a pathological level, avoided meetings because a felt ugly, don't eat or eating way too much, etc, so that's why i think this situation feels particularly hard. About a two months ago i thought i had a cavity in my tooth (i don't know the word in english for "caries"). I stopped smoking. I went to the dentist, it wasn't that, she cleaned my teeth, but i was feeling like my four frontal teeth are moving, she said they don't move but i feel it. She said i have bruxism so maybe it's that, but i literally can't eat because i feel that movement and it driving me nuts. I used to wear braces when i was a teenager, now days i need them again, and i can't look at the mirror. I want to go back in time. I'm crying all day, i don't eat, i constantly think about killing myself because thats just my life, everything goes the worst way it can go since always. I don't have money to go to therapy, i tried to talk to people but they don't take me serious and say i "should stop bother them". My boyfriend really tried to make me feel better but nothing worked and i knew he felt frustrated and i think angry because of the way i talk, so i started to act like everything is ok. Today my mom said i was skinny and i felt like crying because i know it is because i feel so terrible. I used to love my teeth, they were the only thing i liked about myself, i used to love smiling, now I'm crying all day, feeling stressed, thinkin about killing myself. If I'm alive today it's just because I don't want to make my boyfriend sad and I don't want to leave my dog without me because he would miss me and nobody would take care of him or love him like i do. 
Please help me. I don't know what to do and i have no one to talk about.

Text: Hi!  I believe my husband is depressed but not completely admitting to it yet.  We have been together 14 years and have children together.  I love him dearly.  His depression has manifested itself in pushing me away, anger and hostility towards me, I believe as a defense from trauma in his childhood that has been re-triggered in the past few years.  I am basically his scapegoat for everything wrong in his life.  He also is distant, wont talk, and uses TV and books as an escape (which are at thankfully healthy) but spends considerable time in them. I would love ANY solid advice on how to navigate this.  How can I best love him through this?  Especially if his instinct right now is to push me away.  Any “do’s or don’ts?”  Can I leave affirmations / encouragement for him in the form of notes?  This is killing me slowly inside.  I miss my friend.  He is such a fantastic guy and I feel as if he has been swallowed by a dark cloud.  Also to note we are in the beginnings of couples counseling.  Thanks again for advice.  Especially if you have been that husband and come out healed on the other side.

Text: So I (25m) gotta say that mostly my life is great - I have a lot of friends (online &amp; offline) and a lot of people like me for who I am which is very important for me.   
However - I have always been someone who was very lacking female contact. My whole life whenever I had female friends it was something very special to me and mostly those friendships were more important to me than to them. Always wanted to have a "best female friend" but after years where this wish never came true I gave up on it. 

  
At the moment I mainly have contact to two of my female friends. One is my ex girlfriend and we message each other occasionally. I know that she's very busy so naturally it's rare for her to message me. But when we chat then it's always very fun for both of us and we have a great time. And then nothing for like 1 or 2 months. I sometimes tell her how I'm very happy when she messages me and stuff and then she always insists that it's so rare because she has no time. So I can kinda cope with it.   
Then there's another (online) friend who I have known for roughly two and a half years now. We once were really close and even planned to meet up once but then quarantine hit and then the plan kinda fell into the water. Somehow the contact got less and less until it started again about a year ago. Mainly when it's her or my birthday we keep saying how we should get into a voice call again and play some games like we used to. But then again when I ask her later she either says "yeah we should do that soon" or when she says "I guess it could work out tonight" she does not cancel it but at the same time I cannot reach her and the next day she says stuff like "Sorry didn't work out". I'm a very understanding person so I can easily accept that. However when you have planned something I think it should be your duty, if you post pone it, to message that person again and make a new plan. That doesn't happen. Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I haven't heard from her since. 

I have social anxiety and even though that got a lot better during the last years it can still be an awful big challenge for me to message someone on my own (especially if I really care about that person). In these cases I can overcome myself after some time but it seems to be me doing the work way too often. Something you got to know is that I'm someone who likes to live for the good of others. I love to do stuff for my friends and make them happy. When my friends are happy, so am I. But obviously in a friendship there's always two parts.  
All I would want is an occasionally message from these people who are so important to me. Just a simple thing that makes me realize that at least in that very moment I was in their thoughts. Show me that you thought of me and I'm the happiest person. But leave me in the dark for weeks and I fall into  a big hole. 

Worst thing is that there are so many people who talk to me daily and who show that they care about me daily. And even though I'm surrounded by so many people close to me I still feel lonely simply because the desire in my heart for these other friends have a whole different weight. I feel bad to feel lonely because I have no need to. Because I know that there are many people who would love to have what I do. I'm a very emotional person and I can hardly cope with pain like this. Sometimes I ask them why we don't message each other more often. And days after that we do, but then it stops again. Then it feels like they only did it because I asked them to. So I practically did the work again and it thus it makes me feel worse than before. 

Obviously I know that we aren't as close as we once were. I know that they are probably busy with life (I'm unemployed so I'm trapped with my thoughts very often) and that they have other people closer to them who they (probably) rather spend time with. But I don't see how it is hard work to think about my friends at least once in some weeks. Maybe stuff like that is way more important to me than to others. I know that I love myself and who I am and that's why it's even harder for me to understand this. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high even though, in my opinion, they're pretty much as low as they could possibly get? Am I just knowing the wrong people?    
This is not something that gets me down on a regular base. It's more like a phase that lasts for a couple of hours and then I'm fine again. But lately this has occured more often and for longer periods of time. And obviously this affects my daily life as well because once I'm depressed I mostly just sit there and don't know what to do with my time. Everything suddenly seems boring. Even though one simple message (for example, it's not like this is the only thing that causes me to get depressed) would potentially fix it. 

Sorry for this essay. I'm not a native speaker so there could be some mistakes. But I do hope that at least someone takes the time to read through it and give me an honest opinion what I should do. How do you think I can convice them to think about me more often? It honestly seems like begging to me and I would rather avoid that. I just want the heartache to stop...

Text: My husband (just being his usual goofy self) jumped onto my side of the bed and jokingly said "I'm going to be you for tonight! I love you *insert husbands name here*!" 

Of course I kept telling him I loved him in return; how could I not, even after all these years he still makes my heart flutter.. but he kept pushing for me to call him by my own name, like he was doing to me... 

And I physically could not make myself say the sentence "I love you *phantom*"... I could not allow myself to even say I loved myself even though it was jokingly directed at my husband... 

I knew I hated myself but I didn't know I hated myself THAT much... any advice? Anything at all would be helpful at this point...

Text: I am completely and utterly lost as to how to justify continuing with my life. I live in a small town, I have no car, and I barely make enough money to afford rent even while working 6-7 days a week. 

I have no health insurance and I’m falling apart at 25 due to all the health issues I can’t afford to deal with or even get them properly diagnosed. 

My family despises me because I’m gay. I don’t even care about that anymore, but I have no lifelines to help with anything. 

My husband lives 12 hours away and it’s been my goal for 4 years now to get to him, but I can’t afford it, and even if I could, I don’t have a car to get a job once I’m down there. He won’t help me even though he makes 70k a year because I “don’t have the right mindset” but I don’t understand how my mindset could possibly be any different under the circumstances. I have been through every job in town and several out of town that I couldn’t even get to for very long, and the shitty job I have now is the best paying one. 

I don’t have the money or time to go to school, but that’s all anyone ever suggests. I’m not even at home 12 hours a week, yet I’m supposed to somehow get to a community college in another city for 16 hours a week, plus 30-40 hours of reading and homework? There literally are not enough hours in a week for that to work, and that’s not even accounting for the money I don’t have that it would cost me. 

It doesn’t make any sense. I’m grinding my face into the pavement just trying to make ends meet in a life I don’t even want anymore. I can’t even fathom what’s stopping me from ending it right now, other than some primal instinct to survive. I have zero reason to go on.

Text: Has anyone felt like they just want to disappear? Like not literally.

Just like stay away from everyone, where no one that you know, knows where you are. And you just go improve on yourself, fix what needs fixing, and comeback better than ever.

I feel confused. cause I really don't want to go/stay away from everyone, I still wanna be there for the people I care about and the people who need my help.

I'm not sure if this is even the right thread.

cheers tho!

Text:  Please listen and don't downvote me. I've been facing severe depression and anxiety for about 8 years now. Needless to say, it's been dreadful. I finally sought professional help in the form of psychiatrist. Turns out his meds made things worse. Then after some years, I thankfully found a good psych who did make a difference. The difference is this: I became more 'functioning'. That's it. The inner turmoil is still very much there. I've been to multiple therapists (Mind you, we're talking about the most well renowned and expensive therapists in my region) but it just made no positive change at all. We went at lengths to discuss and dissect me and my life and my behaviors and my emotions. All this 'analysis' increased my overthinking to the point that now my mind constantly thinks and is aware of each and everything. Like 'hey you did this because of xyz feeling'. Its painfully exhausting. It's like a constant 24/7 commentary in my mind, which was fueled by the therapy. After each therapy session, I felt ashamed, guilty, and worthless. So much negativity about me. Reinforcing the idea that there is something gravely 'wrong' with me. Never did I feel validated at therapy. Never was I told what I can do to feel better. It was like talking to a mirror. Just reflecting back what I said. Which quite frankly, I dont need to hear as my mind has been chattering all those things for years now.

I am very lost, confused, hurt and hopeless now. I cannot find any solution. What can I do..

Text: I’m turning 30 next year and I’m the biggest fuck up I know. I’ve been all my life thinking I had a great future ahead as I was a better-than-average student, my parents let me choose the career I wanted (even if it was an economic risk/I’m majoring in arts), went through college very competently, got good grades but I also was inadvertently sabotaging myself. I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, my parents were told I might have a mental disorder such as an anxiety disorder or BPD. I went to a psychiatrist for a whole year but dropped out since I wasn’t feeling any different and decided to instead focus on school. But being honest I never truly made an effort in school. Many professors told me I was talented but I was always so afraid to prove them wrong so I did no major projects. I kept avoiding major job opportunities since I thought those weren’t for me and I wasn’t the right guy for them. My “professional” life had a shine of light at the beginning of 2020 as one of my projects was being financed, then the pandemic hit putting everything on hiatus, got no job of course, and had to go back to my parents. One year later: everything’s worse. Still jobless, still with my parents, procrastinating, hitting bottom every couple months, with 3 suicide attempts already, and just shitty thoughts every passing hour. My parents are sick of me even if they don’t say it out loud. I’m sick of myself. I’m a fucking parasite too scared to do anything to change that. To move back to my apartment and find a job. To see how accomplished my friends are and seeing what they’ve done in the past year and me thinking “good for you mate, I just tried killing myself more than once haha”. I’m too ashamed. 
I’m too old now. I see people being successful at 24 and I’m 29 now and it’s too fucking late, still living off my parents is so humiliating. I can’t shake away that feeling and I’m so afraid one of these days that feeling turns unbearable and just end me without thinking it twice. I’m done.

Text: Hi guys, I don't know if this is the right forum for my overall mixed content. I'm 23 \[F\]. And I need some advice on my situation. Appreciate it if y'all could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story.   


Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend.  I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good r/s with her family.  


I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didn't work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news - she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldn't do anything (in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide). However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly (I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate). They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards...   


So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was  really optimistic about this (she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it). When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone "since i didn't know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe." I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me.  Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum - berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friend's action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called 'right path'. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her.   


Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened?? It felt like the mum is just giving up on her daughter?? I fr am so lost on what i should do. Becos tbh, Im also slowly going back into depression and some of my friends has been trying to contact me but I am trying to get away from everyone. I know im burntout but i really feel like shit. I am jobless and im trying to move on with my life but i have to be on my toes in case my friend kills herself. FYI i have since stopped seeing my therapist becos i wanted to focus fully on this friend. I also have called different hotlines available online but lets be real - they kept telling me to call the police when she is in danger. Like I want to know what else I can do y'know. Not like just sit there and wait for her to act on it. I rather understand how I can communicate and try to deflect negative feelings when I'm dealing with her. And yet her mum says this kind of things??? Was I at fault?? Was i wrong??? So im begging y'all, pls lmk what i can do. Thanks in advance!

Text: Hi tomorrow I go back to see my therapist that I have not seen in six months I feel like last time I was there I did not have much progress with my depression and my suicidal thoughts have gotten worse 

there's a part of me that wants to tell her everything but then then the other part of me is telling me no and that I don't deserve to be happy 

Right now I want to tell her how I feel but when I wake up tomorrow I will have so much anxiety that I won't say what I need to say and idk what to do the worse thing that could happen is her sending me to a mental hospital  because I'm a minor but maybe it won't be that bad I guess I just want to feel better but I don't think I have the strength to even try


Anyways my point is do any of you have advise on how I can open up to my therapist or is it to soon to open up during the first appointment back?

Text: Hey all, need a bit if support/advice
As of recently, I’ve noticed I’ve been having a lot more breakdowns than I usually have. These have gotten to the point where I’ve begun to push the important people out of my life. 
On the flip side, I don’t do anything with my life. Besides the global quarantine we currently have due to COVID, I just.... do nothing. I feel bad because I have no job, so I’m constantly asking for money from my parents, which I then spend like a madman, and, again, I just sit at home and play video games all day, despite telling myself to do other things. 
This, along with recent events, has left me highly aggressive/abrasive. Thing is, I recognize that this is not me, and I’m basically trapped under impulse. 

What can I do? Is this Psych Ward or MRI-worthy? Does anyone know of ways I can get help online or through an app?

Text: Hiii and thanks in advance for any advice here. I struggle even wanting to talk about it because my family members are all I have, and they all 3 have binge eating habits. I feel guilty about it so please be gentle with me. 
About 4 or 5 years ago when my mental health started taking a nose dive I noticed I started losing my appetite. I started to fluctuate around 20-30 lbs throughout these years. I have no trouble continuing to drink. I’ve mentioned it to my doctors but they have never elaborated on it with me, and I have had blood drawn a few times, making it seem like it’s not as much of a problem. But it’s getting worse, no matter what food I prepare or go pick up I can only eat a few bites before I can’t even chew it anymore and have to put it away. And I only do that 1-2 times a day. It’s really starting to get to me. 
Does anyone here also go through this? I’ve thought about some kind of protein drink for when I’m on the brink of passing out. But have never looked into that stuff and I feel so overwhelmed with this right now. I don’t have a job at the moment and can’t afford to try a bunch of high priced options. 

Just hoping one of you have been in my shoes I guess.

Text: I had my first panic attack during exam season just a month ago. I break down a lot because I don't know how to cope with stress. I'm currently taking on a software engineering internship and am terrified because I know absolutely nothing and I feel like its causing my mental state to spiral downwards even more.

&amp;#x200B;

On my first day of my internship they asked what sorts of hobbies I had. I genuinely couldn't answer and just said that I watch a lot of movies. I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I used to escape my problems by switching between Youtube and Reddit for hours on end, but now I don't even find that enjoyable anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel like I have friends that I can approach and would really like to have someone to talk to.

Text: Right now I work at my family's business and I get paid 200-275$ a week for full-times work. I am working on leaving. I am nervous for a few reasons, one being my parents say they cannot afford to pay me more, which means they might not be able to afford someone else, but I cant keep going at this rate. I have only just started getting paid reguarly in October 2018 and I have been working for them since June 2017.

I need therapy. I have been depressed since I left college (I have a bachelor's) and while I am not in danger of hurting myself, most mornings I dont even wanna wake up or just fade away. I feel numb and going through the motions. My family is Christian and all my life, they have had more faith in prayer, but I need real help. I want to sign up for Betterhelp in the future. 

Does anyone trust BetterHelp?

Also while I am set and preparing on leaving, what should I do to calm my guilt. While they seem sincere now, I have seen them get very nasty. When I got my first job, my dad said I would be miserable and my mom freaks out at the idea of me saving money. I'm getting tired of this. 

My dad's a narcissist and my mom is co-dependent and my family isnt healthy.

Text: Hi, for a few weeks I've been dealing with this "weird" feeling, some days I'm quite normal, happy, serious, but I feel that I'm using well my energy, and there are some other times (like right now) that I'm just sitting trying to focus in something but there also more thoughts in mind that can't give a chance to focus, I don't feel the energy for do something, I feel with tears but there's none and neither a clear reason for do it, may be this is part for been one year unemployed but if there's someone here that have been through this or something similar, could be useful to read it. Thanks.

Text: So I've hit a wall, and I don't really have any support in my life, so I decided to turn to you guys. Kinda weird for this to be my first post, but whatever.

And sorry in advance, this is probably going to be a long rant.

Like the title says, I live a really great life. I'm married to a beautiful woman who loves me more than anything, the sex is amazing, and she's smart and talented and has a great, lucrative job. I just graduated college (12 years later than I had planned, but doesn't matter) in a field that I'm really passionate about, with plans to apply for grad school. Financially, I don't live in luxury, but I'm comfortable. I have an amazing dog. I have a good, supportive family. I live in a safe neighborhood.

I'm not trying to brag, but just trying to illustrate how from the outside, I really don't have anything to complain about. I'm aware of how incredibly lucky I am. But the problem is, I'm just miserable all the time, no matter what I do.

For a little background, I've been in therapy for over two decades (I'm currently 34). For most of that, I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression, bipolar disorder, several anxiety disorders, and given cocktail after cocktail. Two years ago, it turns out it was a misdiagnosis and it was atypical ADD (no hyperactivity, just the concentration and motivation issues), and I've been properly medicated since. I've had ECT (electroshock) twice, before the ADD diagnosis. My current therapist is excellent, and tells me that compared to how I was when I first started seeing her (almost 9 years ago) I'm so far beyond where I was that it's astounding. I guess what I'm saying is, I've been lucky in that I've been able to take advantage of mental health resources, and what I'm experiencing isn't due to a lack of those.

I have been in quite a few abusive relationships (romantic and platonic) so I know there's some trauma I'm still working through.

But the problem is that despite all the progress I've made and all the wonderful things in my life, I can't feel any of that wonderfulness. I see my wife, I know I love her, I can act on that love, but I can't... feel it. It's just numb. I watch a show that makes me happy, and I just can't... feel that happiness. It's like I'm constantly, permanently disconnected from anything positive, and no matter how healthy my habits might become or what attitudes I choose to adopt, neutral is the best I feel about anything.

On top of that, it's like I've forgotten how to have fun. I have hobbies that I never pursue. I'll buy something, say a video game, and never play it. I have a pile of books I've bought but never read, and sadly, it's not because I'm just too slow at getting through them. It's like, when I try to do something that isn't work, I get these voices (not literal) in my head screaming "you shouldn't be doing this." The more I try to have fun, the worse I feel about it.

I mentioned I just graduated college - three years at a community college (could've been 1 1/2, thanks shitty counselling department!) and 2 years at UCSD. I graduated - though there wasn't a ceremony or anything (thanks Covid) - and felt... nothing. I didn't feel pride, or relief, or anything. It was like I'd just finished washing the dishes - "okay, that's done, what's next?"

A couple of years back, I got my black belt in a very difficult martial art after 7 years of training three times a week. The test was a four-hour ordeal that literally involved, at one point, blood streaming down my face as I fought a marine twice my size (they paused it for a few minutes so I could clean myself up). When they announced the results a few days later, I didn't feel pride, or accomplishment. I just felt imposter syndrome: I didn't deserve it, they must have made a mistake, they made it for political reasons and not based on my skill, etc.

My current therapist says it has something to do with not being taught how to appreciate things - how to connect with that feeling of appreciation. Essentially, a deep feeling of not-being-good-enough means I don't let myself feel the emotional rewards of anything until I feel I've "earned it", which thanks to the feeling, never happens. She's probably on to something, but no matter the situation, I can't seem to make those connections, even if I can act on them.

Maybe it's a support thing. I have friends, but I don't ever talk to any of them. I don't have anyone that I tell news to when things happen - I've tried, but all my friends always seem weirded out by my sharing. When I do talk to my friends, it's brief conversations about shared interests, so always surface level stuff. My wife is incredible, but we're so completely different. We have almost no common interests, have basically opposite personalities, and even our ways of talking are so different that we constantly misunderstand each other, so giving each other the support we need is difficult and foreign. I honestly can't explain why we have the bond that we do, but it is genuine, and despite the differences the marriage is strong, and despite not being able to feel it, we know we love each other and are loved ourselves.

My social skills are, without hyperbole, autistic. I myself am not autistic, but conversations are impossible for me. I never know what to say, unless prompted. Someone says "How are you?" and I say "Good, you?" and they respond. If they don't say anything else, I don't know how to continue the conversation. I sit in awkward silence. I've asked someone how they are three times in a row before. I know I'm supposed to say something, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is. I see other people do it with ease, but it's always just... "how did you know to say that thing you said?"

So I just don't know how to connect positively, I guess. As a result, I'm constantly miserable, and negative, and just... an asshole. And I hate it. And I want to be better, but I've hit this wall where it seems like I can't be better until I can connect with something good, and I just... can't figure out how to do that, even though I know how to do it, and I follow the steps and... nothing.

I have that stupid voice telling me to delete this, that it's a bunch of rambling nonsense and no one on here is going to care. That probably means I should post this.

Thanks to anyone who read through this.

Text: If this sounds familiar, please share your tips/success stories. I need all the advice I can get.

I don't have any friends. I work a dead end job because I don't have any valuable skills. I don't have any hobbies, though I've attempted lots of things, only to lose interest. All I do besides work is binge eat and watch Netflix. I do have a loving husband who wants to help me, but doesn't know how. Now it's my day off and I'm still in bed at 2 because I don't see a reason to get up. I hate living like this.

Text: I just have periods of time where I will have my mind that tells me: if I don't have anyone in my life and all my friends are in a relationship, it means that I'm just not enough for anyone. I never had anyone in my life. It would mean that I'm not interesting enough. Not loveable enough. That I'm not worth it. That spending time will me, and love me is a complete waste of time.

I consciously know that I probably have something good in me (well I do hope so at least). But when I am spiralled into these thoughts, I just can't get out of it. 

Can anyone help me and tell me how they get out of this please? I literally feel my heart breaking because of my mind. 
Thank you.

Text: (sorry in advance for bad grammar) 

I don't remember when it started. It was weird, realizing how much I stopped enjoying most things. My favorite video games weren't as exciting anymore. I wasn't as interested in anime and Manga anymore, I didn't feel like consuming it either. My days became boring, each one beginning with the envy of enjoying something that I (used to) love and each of them ending with this overwhelming feeling of regret. I was more angry, I ranted with myself a lot about stupid things, I was crying more, most of the time because of stupid things (albeit that started a chain of thoughts leading to more serious issues and regrets). And mostly, I was so tired man, and it just gets worse and worse. It's to a point where it feels crippling, like I can't do anything anymore that requires a minimum of effort.


I don't understand. Lots of times, I wasn't even sure if I really had something. Maybe I'm just too lazy? Maybe I'm just tired? Is it really depression?
But why? Why would I have these thoughts, when others are having a it so much worse than me? I don't understand.


I feel so overwhelmed by myself. Sometimes I want to confess to someone, to tell them everything I have on my mind, but now I just feel like there is so much that I don't even know where to begin. Nowadays, I can't even make the effort of talking to my friends. I'm scared that I'll lose them. I'm scared I'm not being a good enough friend, I'm scared I'm isolating from them and they will just go, I'm scared that I'm not enjoy their presence enough and I know I will regret just li'e everything else. 
I know I can make them laugh and smile but I feel like I can't even do that properly anymore, like I'm slowly losing this ability, I feel like I'm not as interesting as I used to be, or as I could be, I feel like I'm not as funny, and I feel so much more things that I can't even begin to list. I feel like I'm a shadow of an older self, like my real me died and I am just his shed, slowly crumbling to pieces. My mind feels blank and oversaturated all at once. 


I feel like I'm not even the main character of my life anymore, I'm not even sure if I ever was, I feel like I'm just a background character, I feel like I'm stuck on froze and I can't move an inch. I see all those opportunities of potential happiness go away, slip of my hand, I feel like I'm constantly waisting my time just by being alive, I feel like I'm losing so much time, I feel like I'm watching all the best moments of my life pass me by and I will never get them back. I feel like I can't do anything anymore. I feel like it's out of my reach, like I'll never anyone of importance, like I'll never positively impact people's life like I always dreamed of. 

You know, the internet is a shitty place, not in all of it's aspects, but in a lot of them. When I started using social media outside YouTube, in this case Twitter, I was around 13. I exposed myself to a lot of shit. To a lot of poeple and events I wish I never knew existed, to a lot of disappointments, to a lot of toxicity... Do a lot of you wonder if you're just weak? The internet often gave me that impression. I think I'm weak, I definitely do, but I don't know how much. I don't know if poeple are just agressive pretentious entitled assholes that think their opinions make them somehiw better than everyone or I'm just being too sensitive and i'td just the way poeple state their opinion, I don't know. 

When I was 13, I played so much vidya, sometimes from 8 am to 8 pm non stop. When I discovered that one of my favorite games was hugely hated on the internet, it made me feel miserable, like my taste was inferior, like I was so dumb to like that thing. I spent, no, waisted so much time defending that game online, and it left me with a terrible sour taste in my mouth when playing it afterwards, like the voices of the people criticizing me were echoing in my head, telling me how stupid I was, how wrong I was to like that game. I eventually didn't even finish it. I couldn't play it anymore. 
And it keeps going. It still happens, I still get that hot feeling in my head when someone hates on something I love and I'm passionate about, I feel dumb and I wonder, I wonder if everyone is like me on that regard? Or is there something wrong with me? Is there something wrong with all of us? 
I'm not even clearly sure about the mental illnesses that I have. 

I feel like I made so many mistakes, so many unachieved things, so many failures in my life,that may not seem much, and I'd agree, but mean so much to me, I feel like I have so many flaws, and those thoughts, sometimes, they're so loud, they're like screams. And my throat is so sore that I can't scream louder than them, so I just want to be deaf. Sometimes I just want to end it all. 



I regret so much things I did, so much things I didn't, so much things I said, so much things I couldve said.. 
my mind feels poisoned, to the point where it can physically hurt. I'm slowly heading to become a social failure, with no lover, no friends and no job. My grades are dropping, I don't do any work, sometimes I'm so tired at school that all of my body hurts from it (litteraly, it's a horrible feeling. It's a bit more complex than that too, I can't describe it but I hate it very much. ) everyone keeps mocking me, sometimes for stuff I don't even understand. I'm slowly becoming paranoid of doing anything in public, like I'm always doing something wrong and poeple will laugh at me, it's like I've been put in a game I don't know the rules of. Everyone thinks I'm a drug addict of some sort, even my fucking teachers. Everyone thinks I'm not normal. 

There is so much more I could talk about. My repressed anger, my failed, awkward attempt at love, my feelings of hopelessness, but like I said, there's so much I can't even keep track of it,like my mind is reminding me of all those thoughts one by one. Everyday feels like I'm waking with a new chain that is slowing me down more, with it's own new lock and it's own new key, and I can't even find the key to the first lock yet. 

It's midnight where I live. I have 22 exercises of math that I should've done during the holidays, due for Sunday. I want to do them now so I can have at least 2 days of fun, but I don't feel like it's worth it. I don't feel like anythikg is worth it. 

I know this is a long text and it's very messy, I'm sorry, I'm tired (duh) and in a horrible state whi'e writing this. But I do hope that you would take a bit of your time to read this, I always wanted to talk about this and sharing it with others and I'm finally doing it, so this is very important to me. If you read this fully, I can't stress how much I'm thankful. Really. 

Tl;dr (grossly) :I have a constant crippling feeling of emptiness, distress, guilt, slowness, frustration and sadness governing my life, and I feel like there is no hope for me.

Text: So for as long as I can remember I have been depressed, I don't mean that in the "oh yeah I've been sad for a while" I mean I was first formally diagnosed with clinical depression at age 6 in 1997.

I like to joke that it's my longest lasting relationship.

So what brings me to write this post?

I've been in a horrendous depressive episode for the last 18 months (over my live I've been depressed all but 6 years, but it comes and goes in waves) steadily it's been getting worse and worse, becoming suicidal, secluding myself, and all the other lovely things that go with it.

I want to die, I don't want to be here anymore, and before you suggest medication, I've been on every medication for depression also multiple for anxiety and a couple antipsychotic meds too. 

Counselling has never worked for me, I stopped doing illicit drugs years ago stopped smoking, stopped drinking, tried exercise and diets. 

Yet, I still have suicidal thoughts and feelings everyday, all day, and night. I wake up sad that I have woken up.
I go to sleep hoping that I have stroke or heart attack that kills me in my sleep.

I've planned my suicide so many times and in so many different ways, (I have attempted suicide a few times in the past).

Now to the crux of my problem, I want to die, but I'm scared of actually being dead.

Any thoughts or suggestions will be welcome.

Thanks.

Text: Hello everyone, I’ve come here for help or advice on what to do for one of my good friends. This might be long because there’s a lot to unpack here.

She(19) has dealt with depression ever since middle school. I didn’t know her at that time, only the past couple years and this year has she started opening up to me. She comes from a family that is overly strictly Christian. Both of her parents don’t really believe in mental illness/mental help and her mother constantly gaslights her saying her depression isn’t real and gets told to just ‘suck it up’ or that she doesn’t have anything to be depressed over.

She tells me all the time about how she’s tired, feeling sick constantly, body aches, has zero energy all of the time. It doesn’t help that she works 40h/week. I’ve been pushing seeing a psychiatrist or counselor/therapist, and she wants too, but she also suffers from severe anxiety and absolutely despises the thought of hiding something like that from her parents because even just thinking about it sends her into a anxiety attack of sorts.

Recently though, I feel like it’s gotten worse. What’s even worse is that I’m the only person she talks to about this sort of thing, or I guess the only person she really talks too often in general, but recently she’s started to push me away/distance herself. I don’t know if she means too, or if she’s doing it purposely, but I don’t know what to do. This scares me. I’m trying to be there as much as I can but it’s starting to become difficult. This breaks my heart and I don’t know what to do.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’ll answer any questions best I can.

Text: RANT/REQUESTING SUPPORT OR ADVICE 

I’ve (24F) been struggling with depression off and on for the past 6 years. My mood was getting better since I broke up with my ex-boyfriend a month ago, but recently I feel like I’ve lost track of my life completely. 
The break-up was the fist time I choose my own needs above someone else’s and it felt like a step towards freedom. Meanwhile I’m kinda dating somebody I have an extremely strong connection with. We’ve had a short but intense relationship in the past but lost connection. We started talking again right before I finally decided to breakup with my ex (I’ve considered it many times but never had the courage to actually do it). I strongly believe that talking to this person made me decide to breakup with my ex. Besides that it really feels/felt like the universe wanted us to connect again in a romantic way. We’ve been dating for the past 2,5 weeks and I’ve never been this confused in my life.
One day I feel so liberated, loved, happy and absolutely in love with the person I’m dating. The next day I’m full of guilt, confused about my feelings for my ex and extremely depressed again. Guilt because I feel like I’ve done my ex wrong while I know I didn’t. Our relationship was not equal and mainly based on me taking care of him financially and emotionally. I feel like I abandoned him and I hate myself for that. Confused because I miss him so much and still feel love for him and the person I’m currently dating, both in a romantic way. Depressed because I don’t know how to deal with these feelings and because I think I messed up again. I feel like my life is a constant pattern of failure and making bad decisions unconsciously. I’m stuck and lost. 
I keep telling myself that the most important thing is to be happy on your own, that you don’t need a significant other to be happy. I know I tend to start difficult and ambiguous relationships in order to avoid other complicated feelings I actually have to deal with (like a breakup). I’m very aware of my coping but at the same time I feel like I genuinely need to experience if a relationship with the person I’m dating will work out or not. I’m pretty sure I will be devastated if it doesn’t but that doesn’t keep me from trying. 
Altogether the main feelings I’m struggling with is being depressed and confused. I’m very aware of everything that’s happening but at the same time I’ve no idea what’s going on (mainly emotionally). I can’t function properly, I sleep a lot and have no appetite. I only feel energetic when I’m with somebody else but when I’m alone I just feel physically and emotionally drained. There’s so much going on in my head that I just end up with an empty and zombiefied mind. My anxiety is getting worse and I have nightmares every night. I don’t see the meaning or function of life because it never seems to get better. I’m not suicidal but I’m just done with this constant sequence of negative events and emotions. I just want to live a happy and stable life. 

I don’t know what I feel, I don’t know what to do to make me feel better and I don’t know which decision was/is right or wrong.

Text: I'm currently 17 and still living with my parents and I don't know if it's the smartest move to tell my parents about my self-harm. It's currently summer and extremely hot in the UK so as a consequence my mother insists I wear short sleeve shirts or dresses she's bought me. I may be overthinking everything but I want to tell them about it and be able to have my arms out freely in a sense but they're quite conservative in their views about mental health. What I'm basically asking is should I just go and take the risk or just hide it for another year?

Text: I don’t know what to do. It feels like I might have a panic attack right now, I’m just trying to stay calm. I don’t really know what to write, or what to say. I just need to do something to distract myself. My parents think I’m doing great with staying home and stuff, but to be honest I’m really stressed. I haven’t done much schoolwork because it makes me even more stressed. I’ve been sewing a lot because I don’t know what else to do. I think of all the people scared right now, and it makes me more scared myself. I don’t want to talk to anybody, because I don’t know what to say. I feel like I want to cry, but I just can’t. Physically, no tears will come out. I’m sorry, I just needed to write something. Thank you if you read this. I’m just in a not very good place right now, health wise. It’s just really hard

Text: Non-depressed person checking in here, btw. Thank you in advance for all the help.

I am wondering if you guys have any insight into why depression can push individuals to act so out of character—almost as if they believe everything is completely okay when, in reality, they are suffering on the inside. I assume this falls along the lines of dissociation or psychosis? Could those be the result from experiencing an intense amount of triggers?

Text: Idk if i should put a trigger warning on this, and tbh I'm not really sure how too. So uh....

!TRIGGER WARNING! 

If you struggles with eating disorders and suicidal ideation, uhm, this might be hard to read. Uhm. Idk if that's good or not. If not I'm sorry. Truth be told if i don't get this off my chest now im afraid of what I'll do
 
I cried so hard i threw up tonight. TBH it felt good. In a scary way. Due to depression and mental and emotional abuse, a few years ago I was severely malnourished. My hair was falling out. I had growths on the back of my tongue. My nails flaked a part. I stopped eating almost completely. 

I'm now clinically obese. Not excessively so, but jumping from 130 to 230 in 3 months was a fucking wild ride. I dont want to go back to that place. Im gonna talk to my therapist about it in a few days, but I couldn't hold it in anymore. 

I'm scared. Im scared of what I'll do to feel better, to hate myself less. 

I'm also afraid of what I'll do if i don't stop hating myself. 

I'm caught up in this cycle of oh itll get better, then it doesnt. And i spiral again. 

Please don't come back with comments like, "get a gym member ship" etc. I tried. It didnt work because I don't have the energy all the time, and then I beat myself up even more for not going. Im ending that cycle of self abuse before it can continue. 

I just dont know what to do anymore.

Text: So Iv known this guy for over two years now and the moment I met him I started to fall for him. We are both mid 30’s and have a real connection. We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each other’s places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn.
He is literally my one and only friend, I’m terrified of having another talk about my feelings with him in case I push him away again. 
We didn’t speak for a few months as he wasn’t very understanding that I couldn’t stop loving him. I cried every single day when we stopped talking and this was during lockdown last year. It was awful, I think about him all the time and I have a lot of trouble sleeping with my mind just racing. 
Mostly When I’m with him I genuinely feel myself and happy, but then I always wish for more. 
I don’t know what to do, I feel like if i stepped away again from our friendship I wouldn’t last. It’s not that I want to end my life, but for awhile now I just wish I was dead. He keeps me tethered here, so I don’t know do I just hide my feelings and say nothing and hope the friendship works. 
I would have been a very outgoing, proactive and positive person but I don’t feel that anymore. I burst out crying a few times a day about my life, I don’t really sleep, I can’t really eat which isn’t good cause I’m already v skinny. 
Over the past few years Iv lost many friends to suicide so I know how terrible it is, but lately I really find myself understanding why they did it and tbh I don’t have the guts to go through with it. 
I’m really hoping someone can share some advice, I have done therapy and seen doctors but I didn’t really find it helped. It’s hard to fully open up face to face.

Text: I understand this may seem silly. Everyone has their own issues and struggles, their own obstacles and problems, etc. But I truly have a very blessed life, I am attending college, living with my father; he and his wife have very respectable income. I do not have to pay rent, I have an abundance of friends who care about me a lot, I have hobbies that I excel in, I am at least relatively proactive in taking care of myself (eating breakfast, lunch dinner, exercise, etc.), I don't partake in self-destructive behaviors (examples: smoking, drinking, etc.)  


So why do I feel sad? More importantly, why do I feel GUILTY for feeling sad? I look around and see people in situations light years worse than mine, and that is a big part of why I find it so hard to talk about this. I start to feel down and I want to speak up but my "down" is just the majority of the norm for some people, and I feel like I am unable to be taken seriously because of this.  


But even more than just worrying that other people will not take me seriously, I feel like I can not take myself seriously, and it feels beyond pathetic. I hate myself so much when I watch people in terrible situations still trying their best to do the best for themselves and others around them. I feel like I have such a golden opportunity at life yet I'm just wasting it in self sorrow and self pity. This realization has pushed me to an extent. Like I said, I have hobbies that I excel in, I go running and try to take care of myself the best I can. I do my best to help around when I can, be a contributing member of communities and generally just be nice. Yet I still find myself feeling like it's not enough and that I'm just not worth it. How am I supposed to work on my problems when I don't even know what they are anymore?  


I'm at a very low point in my life. I manage to put on a strong-front for my friends and family, and don't get me wrong, I am truly happy on a respectable amount of days. But the growing strength and quantity of my closer-to-suicidal nights are very clearly alarming. Even the thought of that is riddled with guilt (But that's nothing new).  


Thank you for reading all of this, it does mean a lot honestly. If you have any advice or words that you think can help me, please don't hesitate to say them.

Text: I know what I need to do to at least have slightly better days. Get up earlier, exercise, respond to friends, take small steps to do things I enjoy or get important tasks done each day. I always say, "Tomorrow will be a better day." 

But when I wake up in the morning I feel nothing and I just don't even care to help myself. But I know that if I do nothing I will never get better. And the cycle repeats.

Any advice to snap out of feeling like I can't even move due to depression, if even for a few hours?

Text: I don’t know what’s causing it. I’m just absolutely exhausted in the mornings to the point where it feels impossible to get out of bed. I don’t even feel like picking up my phone or moving a muscle at all. I just lie there for hours on end. Maybe it’s related to depression and the fact that I’m doing nothing useful at all right now (I’m at uni but I’m already months behind and I’m going to fail my first year at this rate) so I’ve nothing to strive towards each day but I really have no idea. What should I do??

Text: Hi all, I've recently started working again after being out of it for 2 months. I was mainly bed bound, sleeping most of the day away, spent most of my time smoking. I wasn't (still kinda not?) eating properly, barely doing dishes, laundry, and it was such an effort to shower and brush my teeth. I have to be able to pay bills though :/

So I ask now, how to I push through and maintain this job? I already have extreme anxiety about starting a new job, it makes me feel physically sick and I start to uncontrollably bite my fingernails. Whats left of them anyway. 

Any support, kind words of encouragement, or advice starting a job when you're transitioning from bed bound depression.

Text: I don’t what to do. Nothing makes me happy and I’m so tired of being alive. I’m always so stressed out and sad and tired and angry. I hate talking to people. The things that used to bring me joy don’t and I’m just really sad all the time. I think about suicide all the time and I have come really close to actually doing it but then I get scared at the last moment. One of these days however I might just actually do it and that just sucks. I have nobody and I feel so empty. I don’t know what to do.

Text: i feel like i’m stuck in a repetitive loop and that i’ll get nowhere in life, i’m a teenager with a loving girlfriend who is the girl of my dreams, she just got a new job which obviously means i will be seeing her less and less and i have MAJOR separation issues since she was the one that saved my life the last time i tried to commit, but i just feel stuck. It feels like i’ll always be right here where i currently am, unemployed, lazy, playing video games, and only getting even the slightest bit of happiness from her. I don’t know what to do...

Text: In about a week I lost the one person who I truly loved and counted on, dropped out of university, and haven’t been eating, showering, or taking care of myself. This was all my fault, and I know I deserve to be here. I feel worse than I’ve ever felt now. No I don’t want to end my life, that wouldn’t help anything. I just have to come to grips with the fact that I will live a miserable life from here on. I deserve this. I’m pathetic, a lazy, awful person. I think today this truly set in. Now that I’m truly alone I have to sit with myself. I have to feel this pain. This is what I deserve. I don’t know why I’m posting this. I doubt there’s anything someone here can do or say, but I have hope.

Text: I’ve been diagnosed with MDD just about a year ago. I’ve had ups and downs and just really low points. The only person I feel is really there for me is my mom, and even she doesn’t seem to want to try and understand my depression.
My girlfriend tries to be there for me, but she’s expressed to me that my crying and sad behaviors make her uncomfortable and upset. I can understand how she feels about it, but it’s gotten to the point where she just ignores me when I’m sad. I don’t even feel like I can cry to her and tell her how I’m feeling without ending up just leaving the room because I’m afraid I’ll make her uncomfortable or that she’s get upset at me for just being sad. 
Is this a bad sign? Should I ask her about this more? Is it wrong for me to feel upset about this?

Text: I’ve (21F) always been self aware of my emotions and feelings. Always was in touch with it through journaling, painting or art. 

It’s been more than a year, I haven’t been able to do any of it.. haven’t been able to journal like the way I used to.. and I feel like I’ve lost my touch to self introspection. 

I’ve been feel lost, unsure of what I really feel like anymore.. don’t feel anything too deeply very easily anymore and find it hard to stay motivated.

Any suggestions on how I can go about this? Or if anyone has been through something similar?

Text: 
So I know no one on this sub can help my mental health and that’s ok! But I just have no idea what to do with these feelings or thoughts and quite frankly I don’t want to be alive all that much. I’m young, 17 and my life so far hasn’t been as hard as some people’s but it’s not been the best and this last 2 years especially have been shit. Constant battle with what I’m thinking could be adhd, ocd, anxiety and depression (although I’m not diagnosed so im taking most of these titles with a grain of salt until I do) It makes me wonder if all of my adult hood is going to be shit too, I can’t quite imagine myself as the happy version of me I used to be, especially going forward. I see nothing beginning to help me. I’ve tried substances and techniques and they don’t help. Other than weekly therapy and being doped up on some meds I don’t see any other options. 
Has anyone else felt lost, empty, and frustrated in this way and gotten better? Any success stories about conquering mental health? 
Thanks y’all

Text: Would anyone be interested in being a “depression mentor” or “depression sponsor” for my boyfriend? Or at least talking to him about your situation and his? He’s been depressed for about 10 years now and speaks often about how he’s hit rock bottom, he feels alone, that no one understands what he’s going through. He expresses the wish to know someone who is like him but has overcome this diagnosis or learned to live with it in a healthy way. 

Happy to provide some more details in a dm.

Text: Since about November 2019 I’ve started to experience symptoms of depression but i just thought it was some sort of phase or something since I’m just a teenager but its now Jan 2021 and those symptoms have constantly been in my brain like they have almost become apart of me. Plus I’ve started to experience a few symptoms of depersonalization disorder but once again it’s only a few and usually I only feel the symptoms to this when I'm doing stuff I know my parents would yell at me for. For example one time I smoked weed with some people and In the moment I knew I shouldn't do it and but I felt like telling myself no was just like watching a movie and trying to tell the actor not to do something but what ever you say you can't change the outcome. I didn't get caught but that whole time I felt like I was just on autopilot. Idk if either of my cases could even be diagnosed because I only have a few of the symptoms (but these symptoms are persistent) but not all that are required to actually have the disorder. I feel like these stem from emotional abuse but once again i feel like the “abuse” is not like super bad but its there. Like I’m consistently told I’m the cause of stress in my house and  I get yelled at for the littlest things but then an hour later they’ll give me a hug and forget it ever happened ( this happens everyday). I have a sense of isolation from my family like I live with them but I'm like an outsider that doesn't belong. Also I feel like I'm forgetting how to be myself like I'm usually considered the funny guy or that guy just always knows how to have fun that's but like recently I've noticed A LOT more of my jokes are missing and me being excited or funny comes off as trying too hard. I don't really know what I’m asking for just any advice?

So this was saved as a draft about 3 days ago and reading it again makes me realize that my situation is actually a little bit more sever that I thought. I hesitate from posting things like this because part of me feels like I'm just doing this for attention. I almost convinced myself to delete this but I mean there's no harm in seeing what people have to say I guess.

Text: I flunked the bar twice and what is more painful is that ALL my friends passed. I am happy for them but there is a part in me which thinks I am inadequate for not being able to pass it. Everyone I know, even those who do not do well in law school made it. No comforting words can console me. Every time I take a nap I really I would die. I am even having this evil thought I get corona virus or something.

My sister shouted fake news when she thought I passed. I saw their excitement. My parents ran towards me. But when I said I actually failed again they just turned their back and left. No comfort whatsoever. So now I am all alone. Images of my ex when we were breaking up during my bar review was recurring and his words which go like I have nothing to be proud of. I just proved him right. My friends are all cheering up on me but everything is just cliche. And what do I expect? They cannot mourn with me bec they are all celebrating. 

I am currently employed in a law firm that I love but if I have to take the bar again, I need to resign to pave way for my review. I also don't want to stay because the work would get me reminded that I am not a lawyer. It is heartbreaking to leave a firm I finally love. Then bar in our country is moved to 2021 due to corona virus. I am going to derail my life for 2 years. I am more than delayed. I feel so left out. I see no purpose in life. I am starting to give up on my dream of being an attorney. I want my life to end. I think I've seen enough.This life keeps on knocking me down as I am that strong. I used to be but I reached my end.

Text: This girl i'm seeing is super sweet and i like her so much, but im still getting to know her.

She recently told me that she's diagnosed with depression and does take prescribed doses of abt 30mg of anitdepressants.

i have never really dealt with depression or people with depression in my life but i really want to support her however long it takes.

however, she said that antidepressants DO work for her and makes her happier and all that stuff. so i was wondering, if it does work, is it better if i stay out of it? or are there still ways i can support her? besides the basics like patience and listening. 

thank you!!

Text: Ever so often I go on Instagram and I always get depressed afterwards. Not because of people showing off their stuff or saying perfect their life is because I know that’s bullshit because of the people themselves. They have personalities and lives and friends and don’t depersonalize when they go in public they’re comfortable enough in their own skin to be confident enough they have some care to wake up. Even in public if I see someone I wish I was happy enough for confident enough or wasn’t as much of a spaz to be it just ruins my day. I’m supposed to be a teen with a life but I’m almost out of my teens and I haven’t even lived yet

Text: So basically at the beginning of the year I started slitting my wrist because I started feeling overwhelming depression after 2019. My mum saw the marks and told me to stop. At the beginning of quarantine my depression took another increase, and for two days I started slitting my wrist (again) until my mum saw. She demanded that I tell her what was wrong, and I just told her I feel generally depressed (all the reasoning behind it is complicated and plus I don't feel comfortable telling her). She asked me if a boyfriend had broken up with me or something, and that definitely wasn't the reason (so I assume if she knows I'm depressed she'll think that). She then demanded that I don't slit my wrists again, and therefore I know that if I do, I'll get into a bunch of crap I don't wanna be in. I really wanna start doing it again; I'm a horrible person (so I deserve it) and hurting myself makes me feel better for some reason. I've always felt guilt and shame, and self hatred, and I feel like my life has reached 'the end of the line'; I feel true happiness has faded, and the realisation has struck, that life is completely worthless and I will die one day, leaving everything behind. All motivation seems gone, and my life has just gone to shit, comparing it to the past. I really want to slit my wrist, but I know my parents would see. So what do I do? How do I cut myself and 'get away with it'? Can I cover it up without raising suspicion? I really want to. I feel desperate, but I know I can't.

Text: I've been feeling low all the time. I'll be graduating in June and I don't even have a job. Although I'm trying to brushup my skills, but I lack confidence in everything.
I find it really hard to brag or to lie about me. Everytime there's a new opening for a job/internship i just don't apply thinking I lack skills, I'm not good, they won't hire me, I won't perform well in the interview, my resume sucks etc etc.

I used to be really chill &amp; confident. But now everything's gone. Every day I code to be good at it and find me an internship.
Every night I cry thinking about all the wrong decisions that I made during college &amp; that all of my friends are ahead of me , chasing the perfect lifestyle with jobs in hand.

While I on the other side is marching into the world of depression day by day. :'(

Text: I’ve been smoking heavily since I was 16-17 daily with only a month a half break due to drug test I I had to pass , ( I’m 24 now) but lately I’ve been noticing that when I go for about 2 days with out it , I start getting really bad thoughts about about my self and feeling like I’m bout to start slipping back into depression and that is the last thing I want.  I don’t know if it’s the weed in particular or if my body and mind is just so use to smoking that I can’t deal with stress not high . 
I just wanna be “okay” whatever that means.

Text: What's the fucking point? I'm not suicidal, but my life feels like it's crashing down around me in the space of less than a day and I wish I could just blink out of existence. Erase me from fucking time so nobody has to mourn me, they'll just never know I fucking existed.

I lost my job today. I really enjoyed it, but apparently I wasn't doing enough to pass probation (which still had 3 weeks to go). I'm nearly 30, and I started this job in January. It was the first time in my life where I felt like I had stable work, Monday to Friday 9-5 mundanity and I loved that. My partner and I had been going through a rocky patch, but with this stability came improvement. I have been in and out of work for the last 3 years, seemingly never truly on my own terms. She supported us throughout my instability even when things got hard. Now I'm afraid this is undoing all that and I'm scared she's gonna fucking leave, because I'm a valueless cunt.

I would say I don't care any more but I do care, a lot. I would give anything not to feel this. I would give anything not to feel rn.

Throwaway account because I don't want anyone being able to connect me and this self-pitying wank. I want to fucking cease to exist.

Text: I have been thinking of self harming. I don't want to because that would make therapy more hard and i don't want my therapist to do more work for me. I can't talk to my therapist because of lockdown. I want some coping mechanisms to not abuse myself physically and mentally. Thanks

Edit: i asked this because I've seen a pattern with me. Before i was thinking of suicide and told myself to not to do it. Then i attempted anyway later. So i reached out thinking it might get worse. Sorry for wasting you time

Text: I’m a 16 year old boy, I went to my first session and cried, I was so ashamed that I had cried in front of this woman that I didn’t even know that I said to mum I wasn’t going back but I did go back, this time I said to myself I won’t cry or let any sort of guard Down, which I did, another week passed and I go to my third session, this time I don’t really answer any questions or if I did it was “yep” “nope” “idk” so after the time was up she said something like you obviously don’t wanna be here and we’re gonna stop having sessions which I acted like yep that’s what I want too but really I wanted to open up more than anything in the world but thought it was weak so I couldn’t do it

Text: Sometimes, usually after a fight with my mom (who has mental health struggles too like bipolar)when the situation is so unfair to me (because of her mental health, she has trouble to see the « real » situation), I just when to end my life. I lived in that situation since so many years and as is it the mother, she’s right and not me. My dad can’t say anything because she will fight with him after for hours and my brother just be « the good boy » and has not problem. 
Anyway, I just don’t know how to avoid to just think of how to end me or just try to do it. 
Thank you for reading me

Text: Well tomorrow is my birthday. I feel numb. You could hit me and I wouldn’t feel it. I usually get all excited and think about how to do my hair and make up, what I want to eat for dinner. I remember all my past birthdays. 
The past few weeks I have just thought about ending it. I’m not going to but I can’t stop thinking about it. My life feels worthless. I don’t feel like I help anyone. Obviously we can’t see too much of our family right now but that wouldn’t matter because we don’t all get along. 

My dad re married when I was 14. They had another kid. Same exact birthday as mine although 17 years apart. She is the golden child. They even had a drive by birthday thing for her to sing happy birthday. I’m under 26. Don’t want to say my exact age. 

I get I’m older and I get the older you get birthdays kinda get less exciting. But I feel like dirt on the ground to people around me. I feel lonely and I feel sad I don’t feel excitement. 

Again it’s just another day but it feels shitty. Maybe it’s the memories I miss I don’t know. Just wanted to get it off my chest. 

I’m scared to wake up tomorrow. I’m scared to have another year like I just had. I don’t think I can survive it. I barely survived this one. 

This isn’t a “oh I hope Reddit wishes me happy bday for validation” post. I just feel like sometimes on here I can share and get it out there. I don’t really have an outlet. 
Thank you for listening.

Text: I am a 26 year old male, living a pretty normal life, I have a good job, still live with my parents.

That being said I still haven't figured out what I want to do with my life and feel like I have been living on autopilot for most of the recent years. I feel like I have been going through some form of depression since I was a teenager, nothing major but I certainly feel a lack of motivation, a dissatisfaction with myself, apathy, cynicism and anxiety.

Whenever I try to think about what I want to do with my life I just get a blank. 

Whenever I feel sad and try to think what would make me happy I also get a blank 

Lately I have been so dissatisfied with everything that I started asking myself, what world would I want to live in? where would I be happy? Unfortunately, I can't think of anything.

Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions but why can't I imagine myself in a happy place?

Text: So I'm depressed, super broke, unemployed (actively trying to find a job tho), living on an island in the middle of the pacific where the cheapest t-bone costs 30$. This place is more commonly known as Iceland. All food is super pricey and beans &amp; rice isn't an option bc I have IBS and it gives me cramps (I also hate it but that's not the main reason). Another reason is that I am moving out at the end of May so I don't wanna have to actively cook. 

Thanks for the help.

Text: I'll spare the backstory, but after 15 years of feeling mostly bad and two attempts at counselling (therapy) I'm prepared to give medication a go.

I'm not sure how to talk to a doctor about this; I REALLY don't want to be seen as an attention-seeker and I have a habit of playing-down how I feel (you get real *good* at acting over 15 years). I'm in Wales in the UK by the way if that helps. I rarely got to the doctor about actual health issues since it's so difficult to get an appointment and you only get to say about three words during your speedy 5-minute slot with a doctor who you've never seen before (ugh, it's kinda free so I should stop moaning).

Last time I spoke to my mom about it (sparing some details- I've never told her about feeling suicidal and self-harm I do) she just said I'm probably feeling down because I had a lot of work to do at uni and I have a cold :/

I've exhausted the other options. I hate having to 'seek help' because men aren't supposed to show emotions. Every single piece of depression info online just *has* to make sure they tell you that "dEpReSsIoN iS mOrE cOmMoN iN wOmEn". Thanks for that.

I just hope they suggest medication. My two experiences with therapy weren't good- I just desparately wanted to tell someone my whole story. All of it. I want someone who will listen to me for once. Instead I found it so hard to say anything personal or really true, sitting in horrible little rooms full of Buddha statues and pictures of sunsets being glared at by the therapist for getting upset while she sits there scribbling down notes you never get to see and and looking at the clock so she get get on to the next gulible sucker who pays £40 for 50 minutes of spilling personal information.

I know I'm a bad person I just hope medication will enable me to not be. I'm sorry I'm rambling- since going to university (I'm 26 btw) I have been feeling worse than ever before. Do you think it's a good idea to talk to a doctor about this? If so, how? Thank you.

Text: Ive been trying to write my suicide note for about a week now and i cant think of anything to put on it. Whenever i look up ideas on google i get the usual bullshit like "you are loved" or they try to tell you to just keep it to yourself (in other words a fake suicide note you use to vent) like if i were loved i wouldnt be trying to write my suicide note.

Honestlh its not like it matters if i leave a note no one will read it just like no one ever reads/hears my pleas for help, or my attempts to just have a conversation with them, my friends ignore me, support sites ignore me, whenever i try to make friends on a friend sub everyone ignores my comments/posts and if they dont they ghost me after a few messages. No one gives a shit about me when im alive why would they care when im dead?

Im not looking for fake "people care"s or "i care"s im sick of strangers telling me they care when theyve never met me because if they did they wouldnt care. I just want ideas for what to put on my note, im trying to not make it an angry note otherwise id be able to write a book.

Text: I break down into tears every day. I get almost nothing done every day. I am doing nothing with my life and I cant make myself care enough to try to make it better. I get to the end of every day and realise yet again i have achieved nothing of substance.
The worst part is going to sleep though. I feel even worse laying in bed at the end of the day.

Someone spent about 24 hours with me recently and i am embarrassed to let them see that this is the way I am living. 

My vague motivations to do something might last a couple of hours or day but nothing ever comes to a worthwhile fruitition. So i spend yet antlother week where all i do is surf the internet and tidy the house. 

I'm really scared because I am so close to giving up and i reallt dont see any of the rewards of making the effort to be worthwhile. And im so ashamed that this is the way i have been lovong for so long.

Text: I was going to therapy, seeing a doctor for my depression but I just stopped going. I'm to embarrassed to show my face since I missed my appointments and its been over a month since I've been back. I'm getting worse again. I don't want to take my meds. I don't want to talk to my therapist. I can talk to yall since yall dont know me. I just wanted to know if there was someone else on the same boat as me. I am just constantly angry. Just filled with rage and I keep throwing and breaking things. I can't live like this anymore. Does anyone else get this terrible rage feeling in their chest? I've been on zoloft and prozac and they've both made me feel so different and not in a good way.

Text: My friend gets really lonely, especially around Christmas and New year.
This was my 2nd Christmas and New year since knowing them.

On the 30th of Dec, something happened that made me so distressed, I had to go see them.
After that, I’ve been sending them 2 or 3 messages a day to see how they were doing.
I tried to message open things that didn’t force you to answer.
The last text I send was on Friday and I haven’t checked the app as well to see if they were on...

I feel worried and sad, because they are being quiet. What would you feel or think in this situation, what would you do?

Text: Things keep getting worse. I am not suicidal, I have always contemplated suicide but I know that I wouldn’t go through with it. Lately I noticed that I have been thinking about it more often though.

I am saying this because I don’t even know if things are actually getting worse. I can’t even allow myself to feel bad because I don’t really know if I’m supposed to feel bad. I’m trying to justify why I think that things are getting worse by saying that I think about suicide more often.

I don’t really know what I’m feeling. I’m feeling something but I don’t know what it is or whether or not I’m supposed to feel it. But I guess I can say that I’m feeling pretty hopeless. I did Beck’s Depression Inventory and it seems like I have moderate depression. Which is not a new thing for me, I’ve had depression for the last 6-7 years. I’m 23 btw. I used a lot of medications, I also went to therapy for about 7-8 months. I can’t go to therapy anymore because I don’t have the money for it. I can’t ask for money from my parents because they need to support my sister who is going to go to uni. There are no free therapists around either.

I also don’t know if I should go to therapy. Am I being selfish? Am I indulging in my thoughts and feelings too much? Other people have problems too, and I would be lying if I said that I have it worse than most people.

I also failed at school. In 6 years I was only able to finish the first years classes.

I am... lazy. Irresponsible. In the past and maybe even right now, I have acted without thinking about others. My parents worked hard to make sure I can get education. I am ashamed of myself for not doing what I needed to do. I am also ashamed of lying to them about my school. They still don’t know that I failed.

I don’t know if I can say that I tried to fix what’s wrong with me. I attempted to get better and fix myself, and every time I tried I failed. I tried understanding why I failed, and I failed at that too.

I also have gender dysphoria. It isn’t bad most of the time, I don’t know if I should try to do something about it, but it hurts me. I came out to my mum and she acted like I killed her son, so I got back into the closet. So I have no idea what to do.

I have a friend, but she is not really in a great place to help me, and since my friend is not my therapist, she can’t help me in a way a therapist might be able to help me.

I tried just ignoring my dysphoria and I guess it works to some extent but it’s not really insignificant. But it’s also not significant enough for me to make up my mind about fixing it. Also my parents are not mentally very stable so if I came out it could financially hurt my sister. Because my dad is the only provider and his mental state is hanging by a thread.

I tried thinking hard about stuff, and I failed. I tried doing stuff but I failed. Let’s say that I failed to try hard enough maybe.

I can’t help myself. I have no hope from the future, everything is going to get worse. I am also sick, some kind of bone marrow disease. One day it may kill me. Doctors aren’t really sure if I have it but they basically treat me like I have it, so it is likely that I have it.

And I have started to notice that I don’t really want to get better. I don’t know what a normal day feels like anymore. I dread the future.

I also noticed that I have an obsession with pain. I noticed that there is not a day that goes by without me thinking about all the horrible things that are happening in the world, all the terrible things that may (and will) happen to me, how I’m hurting my parents by lying to them, how I should be ashamed of myself, and after I go on about this for some time I start to think about how I am selfish for indulging in my own thoughts and problems so much.

I also have IBS. It used to be not very bad but these days I sometimes come very close to having a nervous breakdown because of how much pain it causes. I sometimes take almost freezing showers to stop the pain, because my body goes into “we’re dying mode” and blocks the pain from my bowels.

I feel ashamed of myself. I’m living a better life than 90 percent of the world. I don’t have to worry about food, getting ill, getting killed or not having a shelter. I live in a clean home. I can take a shower whenever I want. Both my parents are still alive and well. But I don’t feel okay. And whining about not feeling okay makes me feel very privileged. But I’m not okay.

I used to be very into electronics. I used to spend a lot of time into mathematics so that I can understand how electronic circuits work. I actually built my first shortwave radio when I was 12. I was dreaming of becoming an electronics engineer. I always had issues with my gender identity, but it used to be not so bad. It’s strange really. Back in the old days, people had a lot of life threatening problems. There were plagues, long and bloody wars, famine etc. I feel very privileged for feeling bad about my issues. And I’m not the only one with these problems, and majority of the people in the world has much bigger problems, I know that. But they still try to keep going, but I can’t keep going. I can’t help myself, I just can’t. There is no one that can help me either, and I feel cornered. I don’t know what to do. My confidence in my ability to make a plan and execute it is completely crushed. I can’t even stop myself from overeating. I lost the control of myself, I am like a train speeding into another train without a brake.

Text: I have been depressed for the past half-year and it's only getting worse. I managed to tell my Mom I want to talk to a doctor about it. However, I don't think she realizes how bad it is. I don't think I realized until now how bad it is. I'm scared that when I tell my doctor, that I'm going to get hospitalized (I don't feel safe around myself. When I mess up I want to hurt myself, and have.). I don't mind it, except I feel like I'm lying to her by not telling her how bad I feel. If I end up getting hospitalized I won't hear the end of it from the rest of my family (traditional catholic grandparents). They don't understand that mental health can effect anyone, and they would just make fun of me... I just need some guidance as if I should hide how bad it is to avoid getting hospitalized, or should I be completely truthful to my doctor. I love my mom (she raised me on her own for years) but I feel like I would be betraying her if I end up hospitalized.

Text: im in a long distance relationship with the most beautiful boy ive ever met. i love him so much and things were great. but lately my mental state has been deteriorizing more and more. lately i started to have severe panick attacks. when im feeling bad talking to him makes me calm down. but lately i can feel im draining his energy everytime i hit him up to talk about how much i hate myself and how much im sorry. im not telling this to him because it would be guilt tripping as fuck, but if he leaves me i will be left with literally nothing, and just the thought of it makes me fucking scared.

 i dont know what to do. i wanna get better for him, but it seems impossible. nothing i tried has worked, and im desperate.

Text: Relationship with mom was never great as a child, but I always made excuses for her. She really never held the responsibility of my raising it was always amongst someone else. I don’t feel like I was ever raised; I think I was only ever “baby sat”. I don’t understand why my family never gave me away to someone who would have loved me? I was always moved from place to place as a child within different family members. Just long enough for a person to get tired of me and then moved to the next house until I was forced to take care of myself at 16 years old and nobody has cared for me since. It hurts living in the world and needing advice and support but having no one to turn to because all you remember is only ever having yourself. I remember living with family members and only having two outfits and at a young age I was forced to wash my own clothing because no one would do it for me. I have no choice but to think back at these times when looking for advice and support because I never have had anyone. My mom thought she was doing a deed to keep me away from my father as a child; now I’ve grown up to have no one. I resent her for it. But I’m ready to move on; how do I let all of this pain go so I can be happy in life? It’s easier said than done; been trying to do it for years. All advice helps🌸

Text: I am probably the most disgusting person in the world, or at least I feel like that. I don't have many friends and that for a reason, I never grant people any success because I get jealous of it. I wish people unluck so that I can catch up with them, how pathetic. I think about people's flaws and start judging them based on that. I develop a unnecessary hate towards them, gossip behind backs and more. I also feel like I don't really have any unique characteristics /personality. Iam boring, I never have an own opinion, I just clinge to the opinions of those that I admire and plan on back stabbing them once im done with all the dick sucking. Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this *mood* at the moment, that's how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my *hate*  *jealousy* and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why can't I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now? Just end me so that no one has to deal with me anymore.

Text: 
I have issues with my family, and I don't even know if I have depression, but I feel so much happier when I'm not home, when I'm not around them. I spend 10 hours at school but it doesn't seem to be enough. 

Not only that, I have a big college entrance exam coming up in June so I'm really stressed and every time I fail at something, I feel like a freaking loser and that I should go kill myself. 

I know I should go to the doctor but I can't because as mentioned above, I have issues with my family, especially my mom, plus, mental illnesses or therapy isn't common here (I'm Asian) so the best thing I can do now is to get my mind off negativity by doing stuffs, at least until I can get my own money to go to the doctor myself

I read, watching movies, running, programming, learning Spanish but I need more. And something that doesn't cost or cost just a small amount would be good.

Text: It happened when I was in Spain for an Erasmus mobility. I had problems with my family and wanted a fresh start abroad. I wasn't feeling too good already. Actually, I just sunk into loneliness very quickly. There was a community of French people in my receiving institution that was cut appart from the rest. I wanted to make friends out of that gheto-like community, but I could'nt get out of it. Within the community I met someone I thought was my friend, but who ended up manipulating me. I was getting so lonely I thought I was going crazy. I was also in love with my roommate and the situation was very ambiguous. He tried to help, but couldn't do anything. I attempted suicide ten days after my birthday. And eversince that moment I have nightmares of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've given up many things within a few months. I dropped my studies. Parted with friends, and even tried to convince my roommate to leave me alone. I told him I was angry he didn't even noticed that I had attempted suicide, that I also had enough of him being indecisive (he had confessed me his love, but he has commitment issues because of bad past experiences), that I gave up on him. I feel horrible today because of these nightmares and because I fear my ex roommate may not love me anymore after what I told him. I hate feeling lovesick and I want it to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I have started a therapy and made resolutions about work and studies for the next year, but I feel perpetualy anxious and sad. How can I get over these horrible feelings ? I still feels like I don't matter.

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me.

Text: I am 39, trying to cope with my depression. It was triggered by being alone for 2 years, after 9 year long relationship.  I am frustrated as fuck and my hose mate fucks his sexy girlfriend every day in the next room. I am dying inside. 

 I am well built, smart, have passions and interesting job but still can't make any connections with women. But I would be able to live with that, maybe even fix it, but now I am locked with two horny people in one house and I want to blow my brains out. (metaphorically speaking so far). Headphones help a bit, but its not only about noises as you guys might guess. I cant stand their happiness, it just reminds me of what I am missing out on. I can't be happy for them, and it only makes me think worse about myself. They are looking for a new place but it might take months. Same for me if I want to move out. 

I am scared of loneliness. I need some sex but it dose not work for me with prostitutes. I tried Tinder and other stuff, no real results and I am loosing hope with every day passing. I mean I am now talking to a bunch of strangers on the internet to flush some of my frustration away and get advice.

I started therapy but it is too early to say if it helps. I don't want to be swallowed by this demon but it is chewing on me for some time now. Maybe you guys can help me out... I'll try anything to get better.

Text: Most of my post pubescent life I have dealt with depression, but it's only gotten more frequent and more extreme as I've gotten older.

Lately I've been experiencing total anhedonia, where my favorite game, movie, music don't make me feel anything at all. Hanging out with friends is almost exhausting, and I have to fake being positive and laughing, etc. 

Is this just part of growing up? Is it time to finally start devoting my time to purely practical things? Joy is just for children and young adults? I'm 25 years old, btw.

Text: Sometimes I think that maybe I don’t really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. I’m being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and I’m drowning in my own damn mind.

 I can’t keep this up. I can’t keep smiling and pretending I’m cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that she’ll feel bad about ten minutes later. I don’t think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. 

I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that it’s okay and that I matter. But that won’t happen. Not in a way that’s genuine and real, it’s all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. 

If I’m alone then maybe it’s better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why can’t it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. 

I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didn’t take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I don’t trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I don’t want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke. I need help but I don’t even know where to start.

Text: We are seeing a counselor and everything I know how to do to help her.

Today my wife spent 22+ hours asleep or just in bed. This is a new record. 

Her speech has slowed noticeably. 

I ask her what she's thinking and she responds, "nothing." or "I don't know." This in particular is frightening to me. I try to clarify. "Is it hard to put into words? Do you not feel comfortable or safe telling me for some reason?" She says that's not it. She just doesn't have any thoughts. This seems totally impossible to me. But I'm trusting that she's being honest. Is, for lack of a better word, literal "thoughtlessness" a symptom of depression that is documented somewhere I have yet to find?

Just looking to cast a wide net for experience here. Trying everything I can.

Leaving her alone doesn't work. Helping doesn't work. I feel like I'm married to a husk of a person and the woman I met years ago is held hostage somewhere deep inside that husk.

Text: Hi! I’m 19F and have been going through a depressive episode since late December/early January. It’s the first time I’ve had this, or at least to this extent. I’m on 50mg sertraline, but have begun to decline again more recently, so am making a doctors appointment about the possibility of increasing my dose. My parents are both mental health professionals so I’m pretty lucky there, able to get advice on how to verbalise feelings, and what they think I would benefit from.

Anyway, the reason I’m writing is because I’m suffering pretty badly with (what I can only describe as) intrusive thoughts. For me, they’re all memories of times I’ve hurt someone or done something negative. A lot of them are extremely minor or where nobody was hurt, but I do so much mental gymnastics to the point that they seem life destroying. They almost feel like flashbacks, and I get more intense panic than I had while the events were actually happening. They’ll come if I’m doing uni work, watching TV, in the shower, just woken up.. it doesn’t matter. 

So my questions are; has anyone experienced this sort of thing? If so, how do you deal with it? I’ve been recommended EMDR and given details of a good therapist who could do this. Is this recommendation echoed by anyone with personal experience?

Thanks ahead of time, and let me know if any more info is required!!

Text: No matter from where you are and which century you got born in, problems such as depression doesn't leave the world, everyone can get depression depending on the situation that they are having. My Iraqi parents went through alot when they were in Iraq, they went through tough wars and time where they don't have food or water. They moved out of the country to Dubai, where I got born and raised in.

We all know that depression can cause people to suicide, but my parents had another thoughts. 

I am a mechanical engineering student studying in Malaysia, for the past year, i got soo stressed by the amount of assignment, tests, lab reports, lessons that I have to study, and extra work that i need to do to have a good GPA. Going through al of that made me go insane and depressed, i reached out for help ofc, it helped abit but not that much, so I had to relay on myself, and heal myself. And thankfully, i'm doing well nowadays. 

I decided to adopt a cat recently, because first i like cats alot, and second, i read alot of researches that says pets can help people with depression. My dad is an animal guy, so he doesn't mind at all. But my mom has allergy and asthma, so convincing her is pretty hard. 

Today, I told my mom i had depression, and if adopt a cat it would help me alot to avoid the same senario. Instead of asking why I had depression and what caused it, she decided to say smth rude, which was:

 "You getting depression because of school pressure and you wanting a cat is all a girl thing, don't be a girl and man up" 

At that moment I felt that smth pinched my heart and I just wanted to leave the house to somewhere else, she made me feel as if my problem didn't exist and i was faking it just to get a cat, i was soo offended and now i'm scared that i'll get depressed again.

I know my parents went through alot, but they should take such situations seriously, no matter where you got born or in which century.

I'm still very grateful for every single thing they did to me, they raised me well, they gave me all my wants and needs, but this time....it just slapped me in the face and i'm so shocked.

What should I do ?

Text: So I’m 15 and for most of my life I’ve been treated not badly but like I’m really different as if there were something wrong with me  (pretty much only in school since kindergarten). Other than that I’ve always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan (my mums side, ill get to why that’s important later) was diagnosed with dementia (other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody). In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years (when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeks/months old) suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didn’t have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months (tear down my face as I’m writing this). The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died (I still don’t have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened), and although I don’t feel sad about not having him as I’m used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives (although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times). There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder (I will say I don’t think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up). There’s heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when I’m not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion (I know he’s a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans). I’m failing at school since year 8 and I’m always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me I’m an intelligent kid but I’m just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all C’s and turned it into C’s and one D. I can’t focus on anything important in class, I can’t remember stuff and it feels like everything I’ve explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind would’ve hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my “boring” parents. I don’t know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also don’t want to know if there’s something wrong, I don’t want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. I’m sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if there’s anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know what’s wrong with me because I want to seek help but I don’t want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me I’m just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse. At this point I don’t know what I’m talking about but I just don’t want to keep feeling like this. If this isn’t depression then I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to have to deal with this horrible feeling in my body anymore.

Text: So I'm a 16 year old boy studying in a school that is mostly about music, went their when I was passionate about music and jazz piano. I have been severely depressed sense I was 13, with few ups on the summers, I see people in my school, falling in love, getting in trouble, crying after a test, experiencing with drugs a little (which I'm no longer allowed to) they drive down town and have friends, I know it's probably not as perfect as I see it, but it's still something. I seem to get away from everyone, and after some manic episodes some of them find me pretty weird. I'm very sad that I'm supposed to be having not only a good time, but a great time, instead I'm miserable, jealous, and apparently somewhat suicidal. I hate it that I'm staying in bad feeling sad and depressed, and feeling sad and depressed about feeling sad and depressed. And I'm having the worse time in such magical teenage years. I don't expect anyone to solve this to me, their is nothing to solve, just keep going to therapy and take my pills (that seem to get more intense with time instead of less) I'm just asking for some recognition of the pain, and maybe some people to tell me how it gets better, it's kind of stupid, but it helps a little, thinking it might ever end and I'm not messing my best years

Text: I’ve been at February vacation away from school  this year and I can’t help but feel I’ve been wasting it. I’ve done nothing of note, not even watching a movie or going to the grocery store, the only times I’ve left my house are for sports practice which I **dread** and just despise. 

I think it’s been a long time coming but in the past few hours I’ve felt myself slipping in again to the pot of despair where I’m more irritated, testy, emotional and numb, and moody, and overall a pit in my stomach forms that I have to live through. They’ve happened more and more and for longer durations since I began  taking meds and therapy. 

Any advice at all on how to buffer this dread and flare of depression would be greatly appreciated, I can already feel myself sliding into it and just about all advice is appreciated.

Text: I've been depressed for 5 years now and I really need help. I've struggled with cutting and self worth and self image. I finally opened up to my parents but it honestly didn't make it ANY better. I want help but I don't feel comfortable talking about it with many people. I'm a Christian but not a very mature one at that. My parents want me to read the Bible and find helpful verses and seek comfort and peace in God. While I agree it works i don't know if I'm mature enough to do it. Any advice would help.

Text: Hello my fellow redditors

I'm new to this sub and I've recently had my heart broken by someone who i thought was the one, but at least she was civil enough to tell me now instead of 3 years down the line.

A bit about me; 

I'm a 23 year old male father of one and  i suffer quite badly with depression and anxiety, prior to these events I've been feeling lost and the occasional thought of suicide or self harm wasn't out of the ordinary, i struggle as it is on a day to day basis I'm currently under the mental health team here in the UK.

I'm reaching out for help from anyone who will listen, this is my last cry for help.

Text: I don’t know why it’s so hard to be content with myself. Be on my own. Rely only one myself. But I need people. 

Do you feel like you stopped caring about yourself and stopped actively ‘living life’ because it seems like nobody in the world gives a damn whether you’re dead or alive?


Like, nobody ever contacts you or reaches out to ask how you’re doing. you spend so much time pouring into relationships, doing your best to make sure people like you and then in the end...they just forget you. You only hear from them when YOU initiate contact.

I guess i’m just wondering if anyone else has a fear of being forgotten. I spent so much time nurturing and cultivating these relationships but ultimately...you can’t keep it alive on your own. It has to be a mutual effort. And that’s what kills me....being the only one that cares. It’s always been this way.

Being the only one that misses people. People who probably have never even had a passing thought about you. I guess i’m just having a hard time accepting the fact that I don’t mean anything to anyone. 

How do you guys cope with the silence? Waking up every day with this intense emptiness that almost paralyzes you. Knowing today is another day I won’t hear from anybody. Today is just like yesterday and tomorrow will be the same. Feeling forgotten, like you’re just a ghost roaming around aimlessly. A ghost.

Text: I have been trying to journal and I realized that my journal entry is more like a suicide letter. And I feel at peace with that idea. I have sunk so far into a hole - that I feel this is the way out. Im so stuck in my own head, that I need relief. I think my friends rather see me dead than dealing with me and my family has new grandkids to distract with.

While wrong this - I have felt at peace. Truly believe this is the way to go and the way out. While I know friends will feel bad for a short time. I believe my closer friends will be secretly happy. 

Here’s to my family, and every single one of you that made me life bearable until couldn’t take it anymore. 

I won’t give names here but you know who you are that my lide brighter while you were here. Now you can be freer without me

Text: Hey, I’m a 19 y/o male (20 on Easter. Thought that would be a fun thing to throw in) and I’ve been living with depression since I was 9 or 10. It’s just progressed as I’ve gone on. I’ve always been an extremely self loathing person and the negative thoughts just come up more frequently. It just happens out of nowhere. Doesn’t matter what I’m doing, it’ll just sucker punch me. My mood gets really dark at the snap of a finger. 

But now it’s getting harder to actually cope with it and function as a human being. I think it’s been this way for about a year now. I used to be able to escape it if I was doing something active. Like with friends or whatever. But now it doesn’t matter. It’ll just fuck me up whenever. Sometimes it can get to the point where I’ll have difficulty remembering things or having a conversation, I don’t know how to formulate sentences, and it just becomes all-consuming. I don’t understand it.

My thoughts in this state range from craving substances to escape, thoughts about how nobody likes me and I don’t matter to anyone, and sometimes thoughts that I need to hang myself. I want to have a good life but I don’t want to live it as me. I’m way too hard on myself. I know I have a charismatic personality that some people enjoy, and I can acknowledge some of my strengths when I’m more level headed, but more and more I just regress to what I described earlier where my mind just tries to take me down.

Text: I've been struggling with depression for years.  I'm hoping to graduate in the spring, but I won't if I don't get myself back into shape.  Last year wasn't so bad, but it's really hit me hard this semester.  I had to withdraw from a class and am behind in all my others.  I keep making lists of the things I need to do and try to take them one at a time, but since I've missed so much class and everything is already going to be penalized for being late, I feel like it's becoming impossible.  Getting help right now isn't really an option.  I was supposed to get a scholarship this year but it's delayed because of some confusing financial thing, so I'm out of cash.  I don't have enough for even one copay, or pay for transportation to see a psychologist.   Professors are emailing me about assignments and I've been giving excuses for months.  The school won't give me accommodations because my diagnosis is too old.  I don't get financial or emotional support from my family so that's out.   All I can do is try to go to class and do the work, which makes it all the more stressful.   I feel like I'm always loosing time and never making progress.  I try to do a little here and there but I can't seem to keep up my focus or motivation.    I just want to be able to get the things done and feel better, at least about being a semi-decent student.   Thanks for reading this vent session and thank you some more if you have any words of support or advice.  Sorry about any typos, I'm just getting it all out in hopes of receiving some advice before I lose the motivation to post.

Text: So I've been suicidal for 7-8 years, have a plan, have access to the plans mean of suicide but every-time I mention it the cops/ambulance are called. I take 30mg Diazepam +180mg pregabalin +12mg buprenorphrine / day. Only the buprenorphine is on a script, the others were prescribed but cut-off about 4 years ago, since then I've been using the darknet for the diazepam and pregabalin. It is proper medication sourced from spain, with leaflets everything (I even sent some samples to Energy Control and they came back fine, 100% what it says on the box).

Right now, my GP, my drug-worker, my psych are all aware of this (me buying illegally from the darknet and giving zero shits) but I mentioned I'm feeling suicidal to my drug-worker (pretty much as always), and a CRISIS team was told about it. They called and setup an appointment that I went to today.

My worries are that in the past, ambulance/police teams have turned up to my house and take all my illegal diaz/pregabs (I have no ill-will towards the cops, they have to). But it forces me through a 72+hour withdrawal until I can place another order and see the psych team who just ask; 

"Are you suicidal?, are you going to kill youself today? No? Okay you can go".

So now I'm feeling like I shouldn't tell anyone, thoughts?

Text: TW: self harm.

Hi all, I’m struggling today with a really dark depression that began yesterday evening. I feel like it’s so hard to want to care for myself. As the TW suggests sometimes lately I have been so distressed and yet apathetic for myself that I’ve scratched myself pretty badly. It’s like I just think I might as well destroy myself, because I simply can. I know it’s bad to hurt me and if people see scars I’ll be in even more trouble. So why don’t I care? Do I think I deserve this? How do I care? I’m never going to get better if I do bad stuff like this when I’m feeling low.

Text: I'm not sure if this is exactly the right sub for this but I'm pretty sure I can't be the only person in this position and I cant handle too much judgement about it because I an already beating myself up so much for being disgusting. 

This pandemic has hit me hard. I live by myself, I lost my job and my relationship. I am a mess. My family all live very far away. I am falling to pieces and every night when I pass out crying I pray I wont ever wake up. 

The main trouble is my apartment. It's a one bed tiny place to live but its mine and I've always loved it. The work I had used to take me away a lot and this has always been my sanctuary. However with everything that's happened and the dip in my mental health it is now disgusting. I havent cleaned in months. I haven't done laundry. I havent showered or put sheets on my bed. I literally have no clean utensils or dishes or pans. There is baked on food from months ago and actual mold in my cups. I have taken to hiding under my covers because I am so disgusted with myself. 

I have a therapist who tells me to take baby steps and one job at a time. But I have done nothing. I am on medication but my motivation doesnt seem to be improving. I am at my wits end trying to know what to do, I have been down before but I have never got as bad as this. I guess I'm asking for anyone else that knows how this feels, HOW do I get out of it? I am trying to pull myself together but I've been trying for months and I'm failing miserably. If it wasnt for the pandemic I would genuinely use the last of my savings to pay someone to come in and deep clean but that isn't an option just now. 

I am so miserable :(

Text: Hey all. Sorry if this seems unhinged. I’m just gonna try to get it all out.

In the last month and a half, I’ve been having unwanted deep philosophical thoughts on how we perceive time, what the self is, and that we all die eventually. I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 when I first had these thoughts hit me in a big way and I’m 27 now. Zoloft has always helped, but I’ve been bad about my meds for the last year or so so I’m having a relapse, I get this. But the thing is, the stuff I’m worrying about feels so real. These aren’t “I’m bad,” or “no one loves me,” or “I want to hurt other people” thoughts. They’re on a deeper, simpler level. Sometimes I wonder if I’m being treated for depression when I’m actually just seeing the truths of existence clearer than a lot of other people else and that makes me feel hopeless that I’ll ever feel better. Like the system might not be equipped to help me. It makes me so sad.

The problem with my worries is that they’re real worries. I’m mainly concerned with “why do anything at all if we’re just animals who die.” I AM going to die. There probably ISNT a soul. I WILL eventually cease to exist. All the stuff I care about is just electricity and matter and chrmicals in the brain telling me I care about stuff. The “I” isnt even necessarily real, it’s just a collection of smaller parts. I  know that the classic reddit atheist way of getting through this stuff is just saying life is what you make of it, but when really confronted by the seeming truth that the self will disappear when we die, I guess it just rings kind of hollow. Like, yes of course I love my girlfriend and our pets and my parents and my friends, and I love to make art and perform, I want to go to grad school and get married and have kids. And doing that stuff makes me feel great! But lately I’ve just been under this cloud of “none of this has purpose even if you pretend it does.” Like, I’ll feel great doing these things and then I’ll think “that was nice, but I’m going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually.” Ugh. The whole thing makes life feel unreal and dreamlike. 

I’m scared to die. I want to be alive. I want my “self” to be connected to everything. I don’t want to fade away into nothing. I’ve tried spirituality and I will continue to because i think does help (more like a temporary fix though), but it’s based on so many opinions-masking-as-truths that my overactive brain just won’t stop picking it apart and reducing it whenever I try to participate.

I guess I’m sad that I’m stuck right now being a reductionist and a realist, and that my inner self seems to want to do this even though I know I’m much happier when I’m blissfully ignoring these kinds of questions. Now I get the sense that if I ever want out of this, I’ll have to think my way out but every time I try it seems to make it worse. I dig myself deeper into this pit by engaging with it.

I can feel myself enjoying music, art, video games, podcasts, books and movies less. They all feel like distractions, which I guess everyone kinda knows they are, but it just feels really clear and I wish it wasn’t.

If any of this sounds like you, and you’ve gotten past it, please let me know.

(Note: I switched up my meds and they do seem to be helping with stuff like anxiety attacks and suicidal ideation but the depression feels deeper than just a chemical imbalance)

Text: Hello people. For the last few years i noticed that if i sing a childhood show theme song i would suddenly get teary eyed, and so i had to stop singing. Is this also a sign of depression? I'm a 37y male, married with one daughter who is 19 months old. I have work as a doctor for almost 10 years now. I have to admit this last few years i have been receiving more and more pressure, and i have been having lesser and lesser good night sleep. I haven't consulted to a psychologist or psychiatrist, haven't taken any drug. I once had a depression session where i feel like i just want to go and disappear. I was seeking online help back then. This few years though i haven't feel that down, though i feel that my energy is very low, i feel easily tired, not excitable, and beginning to start forgetting things. I usually have very good memory.y hobby is playing games, watching anime &amp; collecting toys/figures, though I haven't been able to play games or watch anime for about these last 4 months because of being too busy.

Text: So I'm in my first semester of college, not a fancy one but one that I was kinda surprised to get into. I've had 3 cousins go thought the same college and graduate easy. I'm not good at studying and have gotten help but I dont think it's working. I'm always extremely depressed and can't find the energy study or go out with friends. None of my family knows except my mom and the only thing she's told me to do is to do better. I won't be able to go into next semesters classes without passing my current ones with a C or better. I'm so lost and I don't know what to do or how to even start. If I fail out of college there isn't anything for me to do besides fast food/customer service. Any advice on helping my depression so I have motivation to study or tips on studying would be greatly appreciated.

Text: As a kid I used to be very talkative and normal I guess. As I grew up I just got very emotionally closed off. Like I have this terrible habit of bottling everything in and not even showing expressions. This lack of emotional display really damaged me. It makes me look so unapprochable and boring. I am about to graduate so we do things like mock interviews, and this lack of expression/emotions had been pointed out by my teachers too. Help me how to overcome this and act like a human and not a zombie.

Text: I am so alone. Not just lonely, completely alone. There's not one person I can turn to for help. I don't know what I did to deserve this suffering. I don't understand what makes me so repulsive that not one single person wants to be in my life, despite trying my absolute hardest. I don't understand what I can do to have a normal life and nobody will help.

Everyone says I just have to wait and be patient and "people will come", but they haven't, and life doesn't wait for anybody. All this time keeps ticking and going down the drain and I've missed out on so much. I am 25 now and still haven't even learned how to be a teenager or had any teenage friends or teenage life experiences yet, but now I'm too old to even have those experiences and have completely missed out on everything. 

I can't even get therapy because they said I have to have at least 1 hour a week of social interaction for 6 months before they will even consider a rereferral, which is a completely impossible goal. I spend like 12-16 hours a day, begging and begging for people to be in my life, even offering them money, but literally not one person will hang out with me, even once. They all assume somebody else will but nobody does. I don't know what to do. I'm so lost and there's not one person I can ask for help. No family members, no friends, no idea how to get them in the first place. You've got to have people to get people and I'm just stuck in this cycle of isolation. Speaking to people on the internet is like speaking to bots who all copy and paste the same useless things, "put yourself out there" "join a group" etc etc, I've already done it for years and years and years and and none of it has worked. I don't know what to do.

Text: I'm only alive against my will. I'm not a medical professional so I'm not qualified to end my own life. My country and all other have banned my basic human right to die. Due to my rights being stripped i really dislike most people. As most people have contributed to the anti depressed moral grandstanding laws banning the basic human right to die. I have developedental health issues so i will never be able to support myself financially. I can't do the tings i used to due to physical limitations. I have no hope of any decent future. I have family and friends around me. Mom didn't abort me so she missed her opportunity to actually help. No way i could justify starting a relationship in my position. How do I exists in a life i don't want with nothing left to live for?


If your just gonna give some bullshit answer on how life is worth living or how i should continue my suffering to keep my family happy Please don't bother. It's not wanted and It's definitely not about helping.

Text: I stopped talking about it some time ago because my mom does nothing and my dad says that it's all my fault because I'm lazy and I shouldn't blame it on my depression because "every human can do that easy".   (had to resit a collage class 2 times after an big operation)

They refused to bring me to a real psychiatrist because "we know what's going on"... And they also said that they kick me out when I try to go there on my own


I've always been told to not cry because "a man doesn't cry" but now my mom told me that it's bad to keep everything for myself and I should express feelings rather than having a really neutral and cold personality
When I do talk about my problems she blames it on me and tells me that everyone else can do it better than me again... (This is why I prefer to be in my room all day long because I know as soon as I walk to the living room umm being yelled at)

Text: I love in abusive family and I'm traumatized because of it. I can't focus in school, can't ready, every contact with humans makes me anxious and drains me out of energy despite that I used to be social butterfly when younger. 

I was on Zoloft for 6 months and it didn't really help me until I started taking 75mg doses. Then I stopped taking it because of my parents' pressure. Taking meds for mental problems isn't "normal" form them. Eventually I had enough of their trash talk and gave it up. I regret it

since then my symptoms are getting worse and worse. I got more suicidal, my emotions are vague and I feel exhausted all the time. It drives me crazy. 

I think my mother canceled meeting with psychiatrist and I don't want to dose meds by myself. I did one stupid thing and that's enough. What do I do, what should I tell them?

Text: I lost my job. I am being evicted. I have a 5 year old living with me and an 11 year old who doesn't. And my boyfriend is now saying he wants to move back home to Norway... 

I have no idea what to do, I'm a complete mess and feel like my life is at a cross roads. One leads to potentially hurting my daughters, one leads to a literal dead end for me... which will hurt them more. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of a background:   


I'm 31, been abused my entire life, by parents, by siblings, by random strangers and ex partners. I've been in abusive relationships, mentally and emotionally abused, sexually abused at least 5 or 6 times... I've been raped. 

I lost custody of my eldest daughter because her father kidnapped her after I tried seeking help for her anger issues. He refused to bring her home after a visit and the Social Services let him get away with it. 

My youngest daughter was 8 months old when her father had a heart attack (aged 28) on our sofa while I put her to bed. He died instantly. I moved cities and my mother disowned me, so did my brother and my grandparents. I have nobody. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up in a string of very abusive relationships, got engaged to a man who left me no choice... All the while, I was talking about all of this with my best friend. He was so supportive, so wonderful... I was going to move to the US (again, coerced and manipulated into it) but I had to meet my best friend first, as it was our one and only chance of meeting in person. So I flew over to Norway to be with him and hang out for 3 days. Nothing happened. Nothing at all... but it was obvious we both wanted it to. 

He gave me the strength to leave my abusive fiance (Who by this point had sent death threats and abusive messages to said best friend and all my other friends, threatened to kill himself and his 3 year old daughter if I didn't move over there.) I became a target for abuse from his family after we split up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today- My best friend and I have been a couple for just over a year. Things have been amazing until he moved here.. We both got a job in the same place, and I became massively stressed and depressed. The stress of everything changing hit me hard and I admit I stopped showing him any affection. I hate myself for it, we argued ALL the time. 

We lost our jobs due to some REAL shady stuff going on at work (tax evasion, illegal activity etc) and he told me he was moving back but not leaving me. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I am now. I've been back to my normal self the last few days, feeling more love for him than I ever have, wanting to show him... But I have just under 2 months to vacate our house. With little to no money in the bank and a daughter to look after. It's her birthday and we'd planned a huge party ... 8 days before we're due to leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

If he leaves and I'm on my own again, it \*WILL\* kill me. I can't lose this connection with him. I can't be on my own again. I can't stand the thought of not having him beside me every day, of spending the next gosh knows however many years only seeing him a few times a year, or only over Skype... 

&amp;#x200B;

But if I move to Norway with him... My girls would be 1000 miles apart instead of 200... My youngest daughter won't see her grandparents as often. She's already lost so much as well... She'll not know the language, she'll not have her friends... 

I'm torn... and I'm a mess. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I hurt my daughter in the short term... or do I just let myself die and be freed from this eternal struggle for good? I'm fed up of fighting. I'm fed up of everything always going wrong. I WANT to run away and I know that if it was just me, I'd go. I'd drop everything except the essentials and just be with him in Norway and never look back. 

But I have to think of my kids, right? 

I feel it's make or break time... for all of us... My heart says to just go. But my logical side is unsure. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please help me guys... I have no fight left in me.

Text: Everywhere I look is someone who is better than me at something, or someone who looks happier than me. I try to fix this by practicing at being talented at one of my video games so that I for once have something to be proud of, but no matter what I do I just end up getting frustrated and start insulting myself constantly saying "I'm pathetic" and "I don't deserve anything or anyone because of this". This is especially the case in pvp games, that kind I most enjoy when i'm winning. Even outside of video games though I can't help but to get envious of literally everyone, even if they have their own life troubles I don't realise. I don't know what to do from here, every attempt at saying something good about myself has failed and I feel like I cannot go a day on the internet without seeing something that makes me hate myself again. How do I get rid of my bottomless supply of envy and low self-esteem and stop getting frustrated at my life?

Text: My mom (f, 45) treats me (FtM trans, 20) like shit, yet my younger brother (m, 4) is allowed to hit her, swear at her, scream his demands at her, etc without getting more than a quiet “don’t do that.” He’s become the brattiest and most rude child I’ve ever seen. He used to be a very nice and polite kid, but now he knows he can get away with being a total asshole, so he constantly acts like a total asshole. He says stuff like “give me the TV remote or I’ll kill you and cut your eyes out”, like horror movie scenarios. I get screamed at if I try to discipline him and tell him he doesn’t need to be saying that sort of thing. 

If I was to do the same thing, I would be screamed at, told to get a job (I’m mentally and physically disabled, currently going through occupational therapy to help find me a suitable job, but this isn’t enough to keep her happy), have things taken away, etc. 

Another brother of mine (m, 14) completely agrees that my mom’s parenting is ineffective. My mom is nicer to him than she is to me, but she’s still unnecessarily rude to him as well. We’ve both tried bringing it up to her, but she just gets defensive and resorts to personal attacks against us both. For example, for me she would say something like “well you don’t work and you’re taking all my money” and for my brother she would say stuff like “well you’re just on your computer all day.” She also defends her crappy parenting by saying “you wouldn’t understand, you’re not a parent” I may not be a parent and I don’t plan on ever being one, but at least I know that no one, much less 4 year old children, shouldn’t be punching people to get what they want and using threatening demands. 

I don’t know how much longer I can keep taking all these attacks while my little brother is allowed to be a dick. It’s taken a huge toll on me and I constantly feel like I’m never doing good enough in life. I know I’m the family disappointment by being trans, autistic, and fat, but god fucking dammit I’m trying my best. But my best is never and has never been enough. I wish I could just move far away and start a new life, but idk if that can or will happen.

Text: I feel really bad about my life because its bad but I feel like even if I made the massive effort to make my life good I would still feel bad and the only difference is I would no longer have the pie in the sky to console me. I want to change but how can I find the motivation when I feel like happiness is impossible?

I made a vlog where I ramble about this as I walk around the street at night in if anyone is interested...

Text: I'm 17[M] and have suffered from depression and panic disorder for a year and a half. I don't talk to my parents about it because I don't want to trouble them. For a past couple of months, I have been unable to handle anger. First off, I get angry too easily and start hitting my head and punching the wall or if possible, I try cutting. 
As if depression wasn't enough, anger is now sapping my energy and the little will to live.



I would be thankful for any advice or support.

Text: I'm 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesis's topic is hard and it's stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and role-playing with other's character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and it's like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didn't active much because of my works and I'm kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill (I'm part-time freelance artist.)  But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didn't reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe they'll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But there's one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didn't know I'm the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didn't talk to me since. I know it's stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But it's so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support :(

Text: 
I posted in r/suicideprevention a while ago saying that I would either kill myself then or never and when I tested my weight on the noose by putting my foot in it it snapped hence me being alive

Somehow I thought that the decision to keep going would magically fix things and make me happy but I now feel worse

Nothing has gotten better I tried to make friends but turns out im still a very unlikeable person and all of the conversations I had stopped happening by the next day

I feel like I should stick by my decision but I dont want to

Is there anyone who has advice that could help any aspect of this. advice to motivate myself enough to make breakfast  advice on making friends or anything that would help 

(Sorry if I dont respond to a comment its probably because I fell asleep but I will reply when I wake up)

Text: I thought I had it figured out with religion. But religion ended up being just another idol that failed me. Now I feel even more lost than before.

I can’t seem to wrap my mind around suffering. I can’t understand why we seem to be in this universe just to suffer and die. Maybe others find enjoyment in life, but I can’t seem to get any. If we’re just supposed to toil and work to nourish ourselves only to continue to toil and work until we die, why delay our inevitable death? Why not just commit suicide? I know this is dark, but this feels like the most rational conclusion. I need help.

Text: I don’t know why but every time my friends posts things on social media, I just get triggered randomly. My emotions go from curiosity to sadness to depression and to wanting to kill myself. I dont understand what the hell is wrong with me. I’m a pretty logical person and I usually know the cause of my mental health problems

 I don’t know if it’s jealousy maybe but I don’t think so?! I just feel like I’m not good enough or that i need to be better. I guess in a way you could see it as fear of missing out but I like to stay at home a lot as well so I’m not sure. I just really gotta fix this problem like there’s no way I can avoid social media forever. I don’t know how to cope with these feelings nor do I understand them. Please help ;(

Text: My friend doesn't believe in me and doesn't repsect my wish to be alone for a while.I have a problem with a friend in which I could really use some advice about.

In mid dec. I told my nearest friends, that I need to be alone for a while. I was waiting for starting in a treatment with some therapeuts, and needed to step back since all the expectations from my surrounding became too much and left me up with anxiety. I cancelled christmas, new years eve and went on the sick leave. I've been depressed since the beginning of last year (maybe months before acutally) when my now ex, broke up with me.

And this has been the BEST thing I've ever done to myself.I do have contact with my mum, who supports me 100%. And a little with my dad, whom I struggle with. And this leaves me to focus on how to deal with him, since that relation in itself has been so toxic for me as well - so much that I didn't had energy to focus on it. Because I have so little energy atm.

This one friend, let's call her "ST" is the one I'm having troubles with.

December was tough. A family member choosed to not talk with me anymore, December should have been anniversary day w. my ex + it reminds me of my sad little family, not so many friends and two earlier suicide tempts (another ex + a dear friend). So Dec in general is a REALLY tough month for me. I went on the sick leave this Dec, because it just became to much.I then called ST to tell her about my choice - also telling her that earlier this year I was so depressed, that I tried to take my own life. But that I'm not there anymore, but fear to end there if I don't take myself seriously. She got mad and told me that being on the sick leave is the most stupid thing ever - because I was ALMOST recovering, and almost starting up my own business etc.I got angry and told her that I just needed my friends to believe in me - and believe me when I said that this choice was the right one for me. And hearing others concerns doesn't help me - but just feeds my anxiety about not pleasing anyone. She got irritated and told me she's allowed to have an opion.- I never told her she's not allowed to. But sometimes she can't see what's proper to tell someone who's having a hard time.

One week after, she broke the bond to a mutual friend who's also on the sick leave.He's much much worse than me. Still ST took everything personal and got angry. Which was the thing our mutual needed to talk about - telling that the anger made her feel more anxious than supported. That has affected me as well. I have trust-issues and now fear any moment what ST thinks - I usually please her. This is what the mutual friends also did, and this turned out bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow. ST  invited me to celebrate christmas with her and her family.  I told ST about me going in self-isolation + staying away from So-Me from mid Dec - untill "??".. This to focus on my health, self-healing ability and take one little thing at a time. While also telling her "thanks but no thanks" about celebrating christmas.Still I felt I had to write her a message telling - "this means I won't come for christmas, but thanks again", Because I feared she would be upset.

Afterwards she textes me like... 4 times.. Messages like:"Hey, I'm so worried, can you please answer me?"

EVEN thoug I told her that this self-isolation meant that I wouldn't have contact with people around me! Because that pushes me back.

I then ended up pleasing her, messagin her in the end of Januray that I'm recovering slowly and that, as promised, I'll get back when I'm back again".

Yesterday I saw her big brother on the street and I kinda "had to" say hello to him. Yesterday was the same day I startet therapy, so I looked like a mess (+ was a little embaressed because he's god damn beautiful and has always flirted with me). I told him to say hello to ST, tell her she's missed and that she shouldn't be worried because I'll still keep my promise and get back when I'm ready to be social again.  (yearh, because I knew he would tell her he saw me....)

5hours later she texted me twice:

"Hey, I'm SO WORRIED! I need to know that you're okay?""Hey, just like my message - you don't have to write a long message or anything"

I'm a mix between angry and understanding.- maybe she's concerned that I'll take my life again? And this is her way to show love - just showed through concern?

\- but I'm SO  angry for the fact that she doesn't trust in me? Her concern makes me so angry... I've already messaged her TWO TIMES even though I told her I wouldn't answerany messages. Telling her I'm fine and that I'll get back. Can she just leave me the f\*\*\* alne and believe that I'm doing fine, taking one small step at a time. THIS is one of the reasons why I had to take a break from people. If I believe in their concern about me not getting better, I won't be better. The last time my dad told me he though I would kill myself - I wasn't having some selfharming thoughts. But then I started having them - just to prove that he was right. I won't let this selfdestructive way of pleasing get in touch with me again. And being away from people, only having contact with my mom, has changed my habits into being able to wake up, going outside, making food (once in a while) and start to work on my traumas.But know, because of her messages, I fear I get stuck in the believe of not recovering. I know it's not her wish, but that's how it affects me... My therapy sessions is mainly about relations. I don't understand them and this is also why I need to start the therapy alone and then, slowly this or the next month, I will begin to open up again and see some friends again.

I just can't function now, because this things with ST gives me troubles breathing. I couldn't sleep and I haven't been able to eat anything this morning or do my morning yoga, because I can't deal with this. It's too much. And my therapy session was yesterday (which also knocked me out) and I have to wait 2weeks to get there again, so now I'm stuck with these thoughts..

I really need some perspection, some advices, on how to deal with this. &lt;3 Please &lt;3

Text: todays polotical news is making me so...hurt and angry! AAAAAAAAAAAARGh! I just...I don't know what to do. News about 45 suggests he'll get off the hook. And I'm wondering where the justice is to hold him and the rest of these people acountable. Why should so many people get hurt? and suffer because of there egos! I don't know I guess it just doesn't feel fair how many people struggle with basics. Meen while they complain about there suits, there cars, there fancy food. All the while countless people would (I hope) love to complain about a house, and what to have for breakfast.

Text: I find that when I start slipping into depression and loneliness and I'd like to reach out to people, my mind shuts down.  I can't even remember who my friends are.   

 This is especially true when there's something I'd like to do, and I'd like to do it with other people.  I simply can't think of someone who might want to join me.  It's a big blank - which makes me more depressed and lonely.    

Anyone have any tips or techniques that work for keeping friends and acquaintances in the forefront?  I was thinking of some nifty spreadsheet but that also sounds horrible.  I dunno.

Text: Last week my depressed boyfriend left me.  Even at the end he was telling me how much he loved me. And he was anguished with how much he felt made me suffer and how he thought I would be better off with someone who could give to me .  This is so hard for me to understand. I would’ve helped him in anyway possible and loved and supported him until the end of my days. Even if he couldn’t give back to me. 

He said I made him feel safe and loved and happier than anyone else. How can I make sense of this? I ask that you help me understand the perspective of a depressed person on this. It’s hard for me to understand why he would give up a source of comfort and love.

I love him so much and hate to think of him alone and in misery. And then I start to hate myself because I wonder if I was a better girlfriend  that I could have helped him and he would not leave me. The logical part of me says that I did everything I could but my heart doesn’t feel that way.  At the same time I loved him so much and he knew it. Any insight would be appreciated.

Text: i’ve struggled with depression my entire life i’ve tried therapy and everything and i thought why not give travelling a go to try and help it or at least take my mind away from bad thoughts. the first two weeks were great as i was constantly occupied but here i am now currently in Nepal i’ve been in my hostel almost everyday depressed and on the verge of crying for no reason. i picked up a cheap combat type knife from a trekking shop the other day and since then i haven’t been able to stop cutting myself to relieve the stress as i have no other form of medication or therapy here, i am extremely unsociable and i can’t talk to people it’s just a personal trait so i can’t attempt to make new friends as it makes my anxiety go through the roof. my flight home isn’t for another 2 weeks and i’m just watching the days go by. I even spent an extra £260 just to book my plane ticket earlier than before (it was previously on the 23rd of april now it’s the 10th) i’m just dreading these next 2 weeks i just don’t know what to do with myself i keep breaking down, i’m a mess of a person

Text: Hi, 

Ever since I was 17 (15 years ago) my life has been crap. I had a long term boyfriend who treated me like crap for 12 years, lied to me, stole from me and was emotionally abusive to me. I had a child with him and finished with him 3 years ago. 

I then met someone, he was ok in the beginning but then he started purposely saying things to hurt me; like saying I’d be the worst person in the world to have a kid with, how he’d never marry me, and also call me a fat c**t (I’m not actually fat) he apologised for all of that saying he only said it because he wanted to hurt me. but recently, he’s started lying to me and then we’d get in to a fight and he’d say I’m mentally sick and that I’m really messed up and obviously have loads of insecurities. 

For the past 7 years I’ve felt SO low! My mood changes so quickly, i get moody quite often, I am constantly doubting myself and after the recent lies from my ‘current’ partner I’ve come to realise I can’t trust him or believe a word he says anymore. I’ve also been having bad thoughts- not so much suicidal, more that I think it would be so much easier for people if I just died- In my head I’ve put in place what would happen to my child if I did die. 

Am I depressed or just messed up from my past? 

I’m so stubborn I don’t want to talk to a doctor in fear they would laugh in my face and say I’m just a waste of time. I don’t want to speak to family in fear that they would pity me. I don’t want to speak to friends because I’d feel embarrassed. I can’t talk to work because it’s such a stressful job they’d only worry that I may end up taking time off work!

I don’t know what to do anymore.

Text: I'm 22f and yesterday my long distance boyfriend of almost 2 years broke up with me. I thought everything was going fine so it was completely out of the blue for me. He said he didn't think things would ever work between us and he doesn't love me the same way anymore. I am devastated, I've gone between crying, sobbing, sleeping, and thinking how to kill myself. I just never want to feel like this again, I don't want anyone to be able to hurt me. I don't do well socializing because I'm afraid if I open up people won't accept me or are going to hurt me. He was the only one I thought I could trust. He's left it open to being friends, but all I can think about is how he's not mine anymore and I'll never be able to kiss or hug him the same way again. I was desperate and talked to him today because I felt like I needed him, it didn't turn out well. Other than him and his friends I don't have a lot of friends. I'm part of a friend group but I'm not really close with any of them and they have kicked me out of the group before for not being active enough. The only person I really have is my mom and she has to go to work tomorrow so I don't know what to do.

Text: I’m 17. Today is my Dads 70th birthday.  That  might be surprising to some people because that’s pretty old to have a 17 year old son. Peers have made fun of me and said i’m probably mentally retarded  since my Dad had me when he was so old. This isn’t what the topic is though and it doesn’t even bother me. What does bother me is that my Dad’s 70th birthday is just a reminder to me that I don’t have much time left with him. At most another 10 years and that’s optimistic.  It just makes me so fucking sad beyond words to even think about. My Dad is my favorite person in the world and I can not even comprehend living a single day without him. I just wish so bad that I could be like every other fucking person and have a young Dad so I could have some more time with him. I truly don’t know what I’ll do when he passes. With how old he is, it feels like there’s really no way of knowing, when. It makes me sick to even think about it. but the hard reality is is that he could really die this year even. Or he could miraculously live until 100. But deep down I know that I have less than 10 years with him and it FUCKING KILLS ME.
anyways if you took the time to read this poorly written rant, thank you

Text: To make things short ( i can talk about what she said to me in détails if you ask) she told me that i had no value, that i resented my brothers for being handicaped and that I must beat depression without help. It hurt me very much particularly as she told that in front of on of my handicaped brothers that i love. I had a panic attack at the end of the argument and now i am outside and looking for help or advice, everything feels worthless

Text: I have known him for a year now, and he’s studying abroad rn and I’m still study at our homeland. He has been telling me about how he wants to kill himself lately, and reply less and less to my texts, or sometimes he just straight up ignored my texts and then came back with a text about killing himself. He has never talked about dying this much throughout the whole time we’ve known each other. I tried to talk to him, make him feel loved and other things that I think that can help him clear his mind a bit, but I don’t really know if that can help him or not because he’s so far away.

He used to use antidepressants but he has stopped for quite a while now and he once confessed to me that he doesn’t want to visit therapist or use antidepressants again.

Can any of you here help me with some advice please? He is a close friend of mine, and I’d die if he decides to stop living. Thank you in advance.

Text: I don't know who or what to say this too, but I'm terribly sick. I'm completely and utterly sad in every moment I'm not distracted. I have officially no motivation to succeed anymore. My mood swings are wild. I'll go from sorta sad or maybe content all the way down to deep grief of the life I'm watching go by.   


I need someone to talk to, professionally. I cannot afford a therapist. I'm 28 years old, single for ten years, no achievements. I'm languishing and I'm afraid of myself. What can I do to get help?

Text: Hi. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for any issues. I've never even looked at this sub, I just needed to find something because I have nobody to talk to so I used the search bar. I've never admitted any of this out loud. I've never typed them to anybody either, just in the memo section on my phone, where I keep a diary in case I end up killing myself. 

I'm not technically suicidal, I'm not trying to find ways to kill myself. I just want something to happen to me so I can just die. I'm currently on a road trip with my kids (two sons, ages 3 and 1) and my parents. We're on our way back to our home state, my husband is there. I want to get out of the car to pee or something at a rest stop and get hit and die on impact, I don't want anything to happen to my parents or my kids.

I've been having thoughts like this for a long, long time while walking or driving alone. I never have them when I'm with other people. 

I have been diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD from childhood trauma, and have gone to a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was on an anti-depressant (Zoloft) but had to stop as it was causing me to have stroke symptoms. 

I feel like none of my friends give a shit. I'm aware this could be my mental illness telling me this, but I can't help it. Nobody ever asks me how I'm doing, and I ask them every day. I message or call them immediately after they post a concerning status on Facebook, check on them on anniversaries of loved one's deaths, etc. Nobody asks how I'm doing unless I stop replying to them for over a week (which I have done twice over the last year by muting all notifications from messaging apps when I'm particularly depressed and can't handle anything else). When I post in group chats about something I'm done or my sons have done, I feel like somebody always has something happen right then and whatever I've shared gets ignored. I've stopped telling people about my life and venting, and nobody has asked. 

Things have been stressful at home. My husband lost his job in the summer and neither one of us has been able to find a job. We were denied for government assistance, but my husband gets payment from the VA and unemployment.

Because of this stress, my husband and I fight all the time. We love each other, it's just so hard. I feel like if I told him about all this it would just add to his stress.

I've thought about putting myself on a psychiatric hold but I haven't. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have nobody to talk to. I have a suicide diary in my phone. I've attempted before (when I was 16, so almost 10 years ago). I don't want to commit suicide, I just want something bad to happen to just me and I die. I know this is wrong and not a good sign, I know I need to see a therapist and get on more medicine but we have no insurance.

I can't help but feel obnoxious, like a burden, unwanted, unloved, like I'm just being used, like I'm a terrible wife and mother. I even wrote in my suicide note that if I'm ever found dead, to cremate me and throw me in the trash. I don't want to die necessarily because of my boys and my husband, I love them more than anything. I just can't help these thoughts and I feel terrible about it. And my husband has no idea, and neither do my boys. I just want to feel like I'm enough, I guess. I don't even know if this makes sense. Thank you for reading.

Text: Here are my arguments against all the arguments to not commit suicide. I’d love some intellectual debate on this to help me reframe and try to stop feeling suicidal.

1. “Committing suicide hurts the people you leave behind” to that I say frankly, I’m in so much mental anguish, that I don’t care about that. When I’m dead I won’t be feeling any guilt, right? 

2. “You’ll feel better soon” ok but it’s been seven years of this emotional distress and it’s not getting better? 

Could someone please help me debate myself on my thoughts? 

Thanks!

Text: Idk how I should start off as but, I'm 17 and in yr 11 I only have this year and next year to fix my stuff up with my grades. Lately I've been feeling really depressed about my exams and my sacs (School Assessed Coursework). I ended up finding that these exams this year don't count to anything and I just wasted my time falling apart over it. And I'm feeling sad that I'm not doing well the way I want to. I tried reaching out to my friends, talking about how I feel, they even said whenever I'm depressed or feel like hurting myself(btw with hurting myself I only did it a few times and haven't done it in like a year) just to come to them for help, they said that they cared but they don't. I tried this morning to reach out.... I got blocked, I'm not really a person with much friends but I usually just talk to my irl friends on social media. It helps to have someone to talk to, but now I have no one. No one really cares about me or checks up on me, I'm mostly talking about my friends about this, my parents sometimes check up. But I need that attention for someone to give me, without it I just feel alone and scared. Now I just feel so alone in the wide open world, idk where I see myself going in life, idk what to do, I keep taking days off from school because I feel like im gonna have another meltdown there. I cried at school and felt so embarrassed and even more sadder when people noticed and stared at me. I just feel pathetic. This whole morning I've felt being sad and cried, now my pillow is wet with tears. I've tried watching YouTube videos to distract myself but nothing is helping, that's why I'm deciding right now to try seek help from here. Idk what to ask for but I just want some support.

Text: So, I’ve been on tinder for some time now. I have match with several girls and had a conversation with only 2. Each one I’ve talked, it seemed like that they might have an interest in me, but that may be the desperation in me since I’ve never had a date or girlfriend in my 21 years of existence. After some time passes, they both just completely stop talking to me like I don’t exist. I feel like once they stop talking to me, they think I’m just another random person. All I want is one girl to date and do stuff with. I’m not trying to get into their pants. I personally think that I’m a huge disappointment, even tho I have a lot of potential in life.

Text: I just feel so hopeless and numb been contemplating suicide more or less daily the last 5 years atleast. Pushing 30 hate my job, really hard finding a new one and once I do my employer sabotages my references and since there is an abundance of applicants like 200 for every job in my area they simply choose another one.

Skilled craftsman in a field no longer required started my own company in highschool which went great for a few years until it didnt. Took my current shitty job to pay the bills, tried going back to college and working at the same time to avoid student loan but during my second year the depression really hit me and I dropped out and the last two years have been a constant struggle to come back mentally. I don't really enjoy anything anymore the only thing that keeps my mind occupied on more positive thoughts is spending a couple hours every day at the gym but even that is starting to diminish in effect. Pretty much isolated myself socially since I just feel worse trying to hang out with my friends.

How do others find the energy to continue trying to improve their life with constant failure and rejections? I feel like I'm stuck on the same page as if I were still 20.

Text: I have been depressed for several weeks now to tje point where I have thoughts to end my life several times a day. I push them away, usually, but I really feel alone in what is going on. While my best friend knows, I don’t want to burden her any more bc she has a lot going on. And when I told a few other close friends about the turmoil I was feeling, they said they needed time to process it and never addressed the issue again. I feel like this is a sign they don’t care.

Text: Hi, I've been on two medications for a short time. Clomipramine for my depression and Methylphenidate (commonly known as ritalin) for ADHD. While I have noticed and upturn in my general mood, it seems to drop throughout the day at regular times. Before 10am, I'm actually quite good and productive. By 11, I can feel a real drop in my mood. By 1pm I'm completely gone and miserable for the rest of the day.

Basically I'm just wondering if others have experienced this kind of mood drop when put on meds. I feel it must be a positive in the sense that I have a decent mood in the morning but I hate how quick it drops off. Any tips? I've told my doctor and I'm not after real medical advice. Just asking if anyone else has experienced this and whether it got better.

Text: I’m treated like shit by the “friends” I have, literally people I don’t even know will treat me like shit and give me a “you’re not good looking enough or cool to be talking to me” attitude if I try to interact with anybody, and I’m the most socially awkward person I or any other person I know has ever seen. I have no one to help me either because my parents get mad at me for showing and signs of distress. My dad does will ignore me and give me the silent treatment and give me angry eyes if I ever tell my parents I’m depressed. My mom will start screaming at me about how me being depressed makes her stressed out and how I don’t even try to make friends but I do. She’ll give me suggestions on how to make friends but I’ve tried literally every single one she’s given me, and when I tell her that I’m simply suffering from a lack of social skills she’ll scream about how it’s actually that I look like a “freak” and a “weirdo” and that no one would ever want to approach me anyway. And it’s not like I’m a bad son, I’m actually better than most teenagers because I have straight A’s and because I have no supportive friend group that would invite me to things I don’t drink or do drugs or have sex. I genuinely feel like the society around me has gone insane (at least the place I live has). 

I don’t “think” I’ve given up I have given up, like I’m going to kill myself either tonight or tomorrow. I’ve started self harming again and my I already know how to get my dad’s gun to get it over with.

Text: After 2.5 years of living with my girlfriend she left. I don't want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it: it's no big deal, I can't justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship.

The problem is, it is not the first time I do that. I have had previous relationships die for the same reasons. So here I am once again, depressed because my fear of confrontation killed what was the best relationship, by far, that I have ever had. She was such a great girl and I fucked up everything.

I also believe that it was not only lack of communication / confrontation fear. When things were going bad the thought of breaking up was constantly in my head. Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I don't have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didn't want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped.

I am fed up with this, I know that keeping things to myself and other similar behaviours of mine are only going to keep destroying relationships, but it's like I can't help it. As I said this is not the first time this happens to me and would probably not be the last one if I don't force myself to change.

Probably, right now I should focus on getting out of the post-breakup depression (filling the void she left, new hobbies, activities...) and move on but there is a lot in me I'd like to improve, just to name a few:

\- Manage &amp; control emotions better - as you can gather from all the previous

\- Be more confident: My confidence is not the worst but I find it lacking most of the time

\- Have better human relationships: As I mentioned I don't have too many friends. I usually have a hard time accepting new people into my life. Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work (not real friendships). I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert "adopted" him. Never a post has spoken so much to me.

\- Social anxiety: Not super bad in my case but I tend to get anxious in large groups, especially if I don't know anyone. I tend to feel uncomfortable and out of place.

\- Be less clingy: I have always been the one dumped and I always have a hard time accepting it, probably easy to understand bearing into consideration the previous points.

I have not much of a clue where to start from, however. I believe I've seen people recommend meditation but I never was too sure about it, maybe I should give it a go? Or self-help books? Courses? Seeing a psychologist or some other kind of therapy?

My most sincere thanks to anyone that goes through this entire post, I wanted to keep it short but oh well.

Text: My sister messaged me today sharing that she wants to admit herself. I am about four hours away from her at the moment. I shared suicide hotline numbers with her and told her to call the nurse hotline number on the back of her insurance card. I have never dealt with this process, but I want to make sure she doesn't face any barriers during this difficult time. Is there anything I can do to help her in this process? We are in California.

Text: **Not looking for medical advice**

Anyone tried Cymbalta for depression/anxiety?? I was on Effexor and came off because we thought about getting pregnant. Since then I’ve been crying, feeling depressed, irritable and lose my temper over nothing. I feel like I need something since I obviously can’t control my moods unmedicated. When I came off Effexor I had about a week of pure hell from withdrawals. I’m nervous to start new meds and would like some input. Pros/cons. Not sure what other option I have seeing as it’s causing relationship problems.. any advise or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

Text: My gf recently has been having breakdowns and suicidal ideations ever since the lockdown has been reimposed. I couldn't visit her, so we've been trying to come up with techniques to avoid triggers like minimizing social media exposure, minimizing interactions with family that may cause triggers, not drinking coffee for the duration of the lockdown
...etc.

I was wondering if you guys have any more suggestions?

I know that this shit won't happen ever, but I still keep thinking about shit and hope that it will happen someday (and obviously, it never happens). I am tired of doing this over and over but I don't do this intentionally, my shit mind does it automatically just so that I can get more reasons to cry! Help please!!

Text: Currently, I'm medically diagnosed with moderate to severe depression and anxiety, and my therapist has told me it's highly likely I'm currently suffering from PTSD. The problem is, I want to hurt people. I hate my family for everything they've done, how they've treated eachother, and how angry they are towards eachother. They scare me, and I hate it. I feel angry whenever someone talks down to me, and I want to hurt and kill people when it gets bad. I know it's wrong, but I don't know what to do, and how to not feel like this. I can't talk to my family about this because they are the direct problem. I hate them and want them out of my life. I live in a boarding school, in a different country from them, but when I do see them, it always makes me worse. I don't know what to do

Text: I'm posting this here because I've been in and out of depression most of my life. I feel like I'm slowly getting out of the "hole" but I'm confused in that I don't know where to go from here. People say to find your passion, or do what you love, but thinking about what my passion could be makes me feel even more lost. 

I've always been a jack of all trades type of person, and I enjoy a little bit of everything. But nothing comes to mind when I'm asked what I like to do, or what my ambitions are. I guess I'm overwhelmed with the thought because I feel like I want to do everything. I have no idea where to start, and I don't have any energy or motivation to get started.

Does anyone else feel this way? Can someone recommend how to choose a path and find motivation to follow it? What are things you can do to avoid getting sucked back into depression?

Anyway you guys probably don't want my whole life story, but I'm feeling super rough. It's a bit of an odd request, but could someone just send me a little fact or even a little something good?

I'm not a danger to myself so no worries there, I just really need something to hold onto for a bit?

Text: I have been dealing with depression for a while and I have a few close friends I talk to about it. The same friends have told me countless times they are here for me and love me. Yet I still feel like a burden to them. I struggled growing up making friends and now I have some very close friends. I constantly worry they are going to drop me…. Even though they have told me they won’t. How I drill this through my head?

Text: So I finally opened to my parents that I've been struggling with depression, but didn't tell them the exact main reason why because of how much embarrassment and shame I feel over it. They've been supportive and let me set up an appointment with a psychiatrist. There's a part that asks if they have permission to share my information with them. I really don't want them knowing about the real reason why I'm depressed. I feel like I'm obligated to click yes because I am on their insurance. What should I do?

Text: I am 21 years old, I’ve been dealing with depression ever since high school but never discussed it with anyone until this year. Last semester I visited my school’s counseling center because I just felt so shitty. 

My depression comes in waves, so it comes and goes (which is partly the way I’ve been able to hide it for so long) but when It’s bad I spend hours just convincing myself to shower or brush my teeth. I feel so unmotivated and unhappy. 

I finally saw a counselor and explained everything I have been feeling and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist. I really want to because I don’t know if I can get through another episode and I feel one coming on soon, but I don’t know how to tell my mom that I need to see one. I am still on my parents insurance plan so they will find out regardless. 

I just don’t know how to tell my parents or my friends. I don’t want to come off as lazy or sad and I definitely don’t want them to treat me differently.

Text: I want to start by saying some of these questions might be dumb but I'm American and poor. So I've avoid healthcare like the plague because it can ruin your life just the same. 

Who do I see to get on depression meds. I need to see a general doctor for something not depression related. Can they also prescribe depression meds? Do I need to see a psychiatrist? 

Do doctors normal prescribe meds on first visits or do they want you to try anything else first?

Text: I have been putting off my thesis for months after I told my promotor I have depression in March. I promised her to get back at it in September but I couldn’t bring myself to work on it until today. I should’ve sent her emails explaining my situation but I keep delaying because everything related to my thesis triggers anxiety and turmoil inside me. Yesterday my promotor sent me an email which I dread to open. It took me a mountainous amount of energy, some tears, and screams to open it, and I found out that she was asking how I am doing and reminded me that my thesis is a part of a bigger project and that basically, I need to start working on it and update her. I feel guilty to the bones now.

I know, this probably sounds very childish and desperate but could anyone here help me draft my email? I have the draft already but I don't know if the content is appropriate enough. My mind is so stupid right now that I don't know how to write professionally and how much I should share. If I can, I just wanna let her know that I'm so anxious about working on this thesis.

Text: I can’t keep my family happy

For some reason I can’t keep or make any one at home happy. Each one of them thinks I am wrong 

Starts with my spouse , my mom , sis , father and kid ( a 5 year old )

I experience heavy shortness of breath and get very nervous and I feel dizzy whenever I am hurt by any of my family members 

I come from a typical Indian family and I am not able to balance the equations

I know these are very common within Indian households 

I think i am being rejected by every one around.

I feel very suffocated... sometimes feel I am not meant to be around but... I motivate myself

Any one to chat pls....

Text: I don’t how how much longer I can keep going on. It’s been seven long years. I don’t know what to do or who to turn to. I want help. I want to be better. I just can’t afford any help right now. I can’t afford medicine or therapy. I just have to suffer. 

I’ve been through trauma, deaths of friends, been abandoned by people I loved. I have to deal with living with parents who don’t accept me for being gay. It’s all just so much. Way too much for one person to bear. Like a heavy weight on my chest, holding me down, restricting my breathing. As if any day now, my ribcage will splinter under the weight and pierce my heart. 

I need help. Please. I’m desperate. Anyone who’s willing to listen or help, I need you. I’m afraid of what might happen if I can’t take the pain anymore. I don’t want to die. Please. Anyone.

Text: I apologize if this doesn’t fit the sub. Anyway, I feel like nobody cares a about me. I recently got ghosted from my first relationship. Which fucking hurts. Everything seemed fine, and she always made me feel so good about myself. Now she’s gone, i don’t think there’s a single person other than parents that actually care for me. I have friends, but I’ve been the punching bag or tool of every friend group I’ve been in. Nobody I know will go slightly out of there way to help me. My sister acts nice to me around her bf, but otherwise she treats me like everyone else treats me. I feel lost. I don’t know what to do anymore. Help?

Text: I’m really so fucking tired and I don’t even know why I’m feeling so bad. I hate my family life, it’s full of abuse every single day and it stays on my shoulders no matter what. If I were to open up about it I’d need to do it every day and I would become the same thing I hate so much. I’m at my limit. I’ve been wanting to cry and vent to someone all day but it’s not coming out.. it’s not coming out, talking about my problems wouldn’t make them go away. I don’t know how to fight this emotion. I mean, I have for years; I’ve always win against it. But I’m starting to.. give up, really, I want to give up. I don’t see what’s worth fighting for anymore. Everything everyone says about it sounds so.. empty and hollow and repetitive. I just want to rest. But instead, I’m aggressive towards the ones who did nothing to me. I lay around like a sloth and I don’t do what I’m supposed to do, I end up useless and obnoxious. It’s a vicious cycle, I’m stuck in it. It’s endless. I’m scared I’ll feel this way, scared, my entire life.

Text: So I recently been in a very bad time noticing that my friends actually are very toxic when we have a fight they tend to hurt me on purpose with things I told them. or well forget to invite me to stuff etc. so I cutted some of them off and trying to reconnect to people that showed interest in me.
But I pushed them away because i habe major trust issues because if my past.
But they don't seem to be that interested which I can understand but it still hurt.

And I do found a nice group of two peps to chill but of course they aren't always available and even if I'm hanging out with them I tend to feel lonley thinking about my past and stuff, not always tho it mostly happens when I see other friend hanging around questioning why they didn't invite me.
Or why other "friends" don't look out for me.
I know everyone has a life and is busy but why can't I be a part of it.
I mostly think it's my fault (but I don't think always like that). But it's hard to keep that mindset away if this was always your whole love friends coming and leaving.

Text: Hello guys, 

I'm dealing with a problem, maybe it's not a big one, but I want to confess it to someone. I started realizing that I'm not passionate about anything and I do the daily activities just like a "to do list", here including: watching series, looking at videos on Youtube. I do them and I don't feel anything : no surprise, no fascination, no hatred. My friends talk around me about their passions, their dreams and I feel I have no direction and also I feel everything is pointless. Even the field I study in College is not so fascinating or surprising, it's just decent and I can learn that quantify of information.

I'm just lost in this whole target wind : passions, dreams, getting a gf, future plans (I don't have any and I don't feel I can make any) and I feel like an empty vase without feelings.

Any suggestions for my problem?

Text: I have a dream that one day i'll get married with a man that will appreciate me for who I am and what I'll be thinking; and accept me for who I am. 

Anyways, My twin sister thinks I'm lesbian, gay would do bad, etc. 

She wants to put me away because she thinks I'm not fit for my own well-being for acting like a child. When I don't know how to handle pain, and don't like it when people are controlling towards me. I'm afraid of my sister trying to control my life and how I should act. She wants to get rid of me. Because She thinks I'm a weird crazy person. Yet I have Autism and I have depression and bipolar.

I'm depressed because of my twin sister always wanting to get rid of me because she don't like how calm and normal I am for being a person. 

I want to be accepted for who I am.

I dream about love and my family thinks its not normal for me to come out clean and say, ''I want my fairytale dream to come true'' But my sister wants to take away my dream, my life, my stuff, and put me away, before I know it I could be thrown to hell. x.x

Text: Don't know if this the right subreddit but I'm feeling sad and very stressed out. If it was possible I would just open my skull and pour some ice cold water. This has been going on for the last 8 years. I have always been an introvert but I am now having difficulty just thinking what to do next. I don't have a job and don't have any friends who are near to me. Everytime something bad happens I automatically try thinking of the worst possible consequences of my actions. I don't want this fear in my life. Also I'm having difficulty doing normal things. I would keep procrastinating to avoid accepting the situation I'm in and making things better. I have been thinking of suicide a lot these days but I know that's not the answer. Sorry if this was unstructured rambling. Just need some help and guidance.

Text: I’m wondering if there’s anyone here who can relate... I am on my doctoral internship which, is my last step towards getting my doctorate in clinical psychology.  I had to move 1000 miles to start my internship which is obviously stressful because I’m away from everything familiar and my support system. And it’s stressful because I’m stepping into new role working 40  hours a week as a professional, rather than being a student and working part time.

 And my anxiety has affected my work. And the more my supervisors have provided what was intended to be constructive criticism the more I have felt like a worthless piece of s. And the more I’ve messed up, the worse their criticism has gotten. And now my supervisors want to meet with me next week. Pretty sure I’m going to be put into some kind of remediation. Or fired. And I feel like such a worthless failure I don’t think I can make it through this year. And I can’t help but think that my life is over, and I should just be done with this.  

My 8+ years of education in psychology and hundreds of hours of therapy have not helped me get away from the feeling that I am worthless as a human being. I know where it comes from, but that doesn’t solve things. I can’t use cognitive restructuring to think myself out of how I am feeling. I have tried and I’ve tried and I don’t know if I can do it anymore. Sometimes I think I’m going to be OK, I think I can pull myself out of this. But wondering if there’s anyone out there who can also understand what it’s like to understand themselves on an intellectual level but still feel completely unable to fix their self-destructive behavior? Any therapists who can pay attention to their patients’ needs and then be unable to meet their own, or who wonder how they can help clients when their clients are more healthy than they are?

I'm scared that i might end up doing something and i've been contemplating telling one of them for the past week but i don't know how to go about it. I've tried asking to talk about something (i didn't say suicide specifically) a couple times to one of them but It either ends up being a bad time, or i just chicken out on the day we were supposed to talk. How am i supposed  to go about doing this without feeling scared, or feeling like i might offend them in some way

Text: My friend has had depression for at least 4 years now. My friends and I have been helping him through his depression for a while. He's been through therapy and had been admitted to  a mental hospital about a year ago for attempted suicide and self harm. But it doesn't feel like anything is changing. He's still numb with not much to look forward to, and I don't know what he wants to do with his life. I need some advice, because I don't know how much longer he can hold on before he inevitably kills himself.

Text: First off im not sure if i have depression or not, i hope thats not a problem here, but I want to tell my parents how i feel and have been feeling for the past 2 years now, i just don't know how to even begin to do that, if anyone here has had to do this or knows a good way to do it plz let me know ( ive never told or hinted at this to my parents before, i think they know something wrong but they most likely are thinking laziness or something) im scared as hell of doing this to but i feel like i have to because im afraid of myself at this point, what i might do, ive been thinking about suicide for a while now, i hardly smile and its genuine, i don't want to die but at the same time i do but thats not the point, im not on meds and im not going to a therapist, hell i dont even know whats wrong with me, thats why i need to tell them so i can figure out how to help myself

Text: I am just wondering if there is anyone out there that is cheerful and happy on the outside but deep down you are just very sad and lonely yet .... you are not really lonely you have friends family a job you play sports your active and always busy. Even when people aren't very dependable or maybe mean to you .... you always just want to help you want to make people happy and really its because deep down you are not happy. Just for a moment sometimes you really want someone to notice but they don't cause you are putting them first and making them happy but no matter how hard you and try and not matter how much you know you should put yourself first you don't...... I often feel there is no end in sight that this is who I am.....

Text: I never get any replies on this subreddit, but here I am again prostrating myself to all who dare to read my post! I suffer from insomnia, migraines, chest pain, muscle pain, the list goes on and on. My body is a broken temple, and I am but nineteen years old, yet the doctors claim nothing is wrong with me. Not a day goes by when I don't consider suicide due to my physical maladies.

My physical maladies are only the start! After all, according to my Psychiatrist, I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and Autism. My father didn't want to raise me. I have a mother who berates me regularly and my step-father who is an anger-addict. I don't have any friends. I've had five jobs in the past 365 days, but none of them have worked out. Hell, I can't even figure out for gender identity or sexual orientation for crying out loud!

I know someone is going to tell me to go see a therapist and a doctor, but all I can say is that I do. It doesn't matter. I'm broken. I expect to die of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, or some other such terminal disease. Life has lost all its meaning. I would rather be dead that going through all this suffering. And nobody seems to ever read my posts, and if they do, they write insulting replies. 

I am worse than Hitler and Stalin combined. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I'm going to take some medication to gain me three or four hours of sleep. I know nobody will read this, so who cares? Pizza! Pineapple! Carl Jung! Dead babies! Quantum Mechanics!

Text: I just don't know anymore. Most of my friends from last year hate me, the new ones I've made don't know me, and they would hate me if they did, so I only have one person left to go to, my best friend, and I can't talk to them very often anyway (it's a long story). I don't have anyone. My own family, the people I live with, have no idea who I am, and I don't want them to know, because I would be disowned if they did, so I isolate myself in my room all day. It's like everything is against me. I come home and do literally nothing for hours. I just have these terrible thoughts and I don't know what to do with them. I self harmed for a while, but my best friend talked me out of it. It's been hard to live like this. Having nothing, going nowhere, no idea what I want. And to make it all even worse, I just found out I'm gay, so I have to figure out how to hide it from people who I don't want knowing, how to come out, and when. I just want someone to talk to. Any help, any advice, is very appreciated.

Text: Hi guys,

Like the title states.. I fell back into my depression spiral 2 weeks ago after getting fired at work. It started with just the binge eating part, but then i started neglecting my hygiene again, not showering, not leaving my house, ignoring everyone.. Started oversleeping and eating like crap/not exercising made me feel awful physically and very worn out. 

I gained 5 or so pounds, i skipped working out for 2 weeks and my sleep schedule is messed up (either sleeping 2 hrs or up to 14, no inbetween). My anxiety due to low confidence is back full force. 

I know i shouldn’t be hard on myself, but i feel awful. 

Any tips on how to get back on track?

Text: It’s a long post, but I will appreciate any feedback from anyone who decides to read it!

My struggle with depression started around 2017/2018. I’m currently 18yo. Sometimes I’m more stable than the other day, there are the times that I’m capable of controlling how I response to big waves of emotions. But it’s never totally gone, it likes to come back and my behavior is often caused by some unhealed memories or habits from my lowest times. I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I can’t help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am.
I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he won’t listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men (my oldest brother and my father) and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since I’m the oldest girl I’m expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. I’m also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and what’s given to me, that’s why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly.
I graduated high school with average results, I’m neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I don’t have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, it’s something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I don’t stand out in any way.
I was never liked at school. I felt like outsider wherever I went. Nobody was ever in love with me. I never had a friend, first people that I started to hangout with I met a year ago. For majority of my life I was overweight, at some point I was even obese. I lost over 50lbs (23kg) a year ago and I do everything to maintain my weight on a healthy level. I have to be focused on what I eat, I gain weight in the matter of days. Every cheat day feels like one step closer to my past self. My relationship with food is extremely bad and I don’t know how to change it.
I don’t fit anywhere. I don’t feel good in any place, I shout my mouth around people for them not to be forced to hear about my problems that sometimes spill out through my mouth unintentionally.
Who would want to be around with such a loser for longer anyway?
I met a boy online, after a couple of months we became really good friends. We always have something to talk about, we share so many experiences and he respects me and wants only good for me. I had a hard time with men because of my father, I never believed they would value me or they would use me quickly after getting along. But this guy showed me that there are good men out there, with a softer side and responsible mind. After talking and calling each other for a longer time I realized how safer and calmer I feel now that he’s in my life. Even unconsciously I feel his gentle presence. Now I think that I realized what does love mean and that I have feelings for him. He’s from a different country though. I was saving up for plane tickets and the trip there, I started planning everything in March and look, it’s July and nothing happened. Even though I was researching all the legal information, translating documents, buying necessary things, keeping myself updated on flights, I’m still here. And I have no idea if I will ever get there. There are too many obstacles.
I can’t tell anyone about it besides my friend himself, nobody thinks here that online relationship can be real, if it’s either just friendship or a spark of love. It’s too dangerous and too much risk involved. Can’t disagree, but I don’t think it’s true in our case. Even though it’s been a year, we’re exchanging pictures and we made phone calls and the risk still exists, but it’s limited, but they don’t even want to think about it.
And whoever had someone dear to their heart away for long know how much it hurts when you can’t even see them smiling in real life or hug them when they need it.
I’m a failure. No job, no university perspectives, not a lot of money, best friend 1300 miles away.
Nobody takes my emotional exhaustion seriously, it’s not even a valid argument anywhere. Usually even I don’t believe it is.
I have not the slightest idea what to do with my life. There’s too much pressure on me and I can’t take it anymore. I feel like completely giving up. I was meant to be lonely. My life is just meant to be miserable.

Text: My meds stopped working. I cry all day long, often times in public when I'm forced to go out. Working towards finding a clinical psychologist to get a proper diagnosis but availability is proving to be scarce. My few friends are tired of babysitting me and my kids are avoiding me completely and the isolation is killing me. I hate the idea of tomorrow but all I want is to go to sleep and be done with today. Anyone that is going through or has gone through this, how do you cope with the crippling loneliness? If your support circle has been put through too much strain what was the move that pulled you out of the spiral? Thank you so much for reading.

Text: So I'm 27, and a single mom for the last year to 2 &amp; 6 yr olds. I'm currently a sahm working remotely for a few hours a week, going to be starting school online next month, and I will be looking for a job that provides more for my family. 
The trouble is I've been battling post partum anxiety and depression since i had my last little one. So just a little more than 2 years. 

My depression had improved greatly in the last few months but recently it's been fluctuating again (I was sick for 2 weeks and now my kids are both sick as well as my roommate) this has made things very difficult and I've had a lot of health problems at the end of last year that made it difficult to get important things done. 
Well, now I've reached a point where I have zero motivation. I just feel so overwhelmed by everything I have to get done and even making a to do list, and today sending it to my LDR partner with the idea that he will check at the end of the day to see how much I accomplished has done nothing except make me feel more depressed and anxious. 

I'm having trouble thinking, I've stopped eating properly and making sure to drink water every day (my SO has been helping to encourage me to do these things properly) and I'm just having trouble making myself focus and chill out enough to get things done. 

Today I was going to do things... but then I had kids screaming and crying all day and I couldnt do hardly anything. Now it's the end of the day, I've managed to eat and drink water today (more water than usual but not enough yet) and I'm just feeling really sick again. I dont know if its stress or if I'm just burnt out or what it is. This might not even make any sense because I'm having trouble thinking. 

I hate that I cant get myself motivated and actually accomplish things. I hate that I cant do better. I just feel like complete shit.

Text: Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that I'm finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? I'd rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. I've seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said I'm 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, I'm still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 12-14 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise I'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because I'm too depressed to even crave food, I can tell I'm hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless I'm smoking weed. I've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. I'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just don't understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (Including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like "crackhead" or "you look like an old man", "you look like a hobo", "Looks like Albert Einstein", "Do you wash your hair?" and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is "illegal" to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that I'll be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life) Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone else's rule?  Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? I'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just don't know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position I'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. I'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what I'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something I'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. I'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. There's a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day I just imagine how peaceful it'd be after I kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world. Its almost too good to be true but I guess thats a fair trade for my life.

Text: Hi first time posting so I’m a little nervous but basically, I have been on lexapro for a while for depression and anxiety but I don’t know if it’s helping I never really said anything because I thought it would take time but it’s been over a year, and still not too many results , it hasn’t been completely useless and I don’t know if maybe I just don’t understand how they work and it’s doing it’s job, but I just feel like I need a change. I’m going to the doctor who prescribed my medicine tomorrow and am wondering If I should bring it up?

I’m dealing with depression and anxiety and insecurities with my look for the past 3 years.
I want to change my life but i cant 
My way of living,mybody,etc..
But at the end i failed again.

My family doesn’t know what i go through at all,when i talked to them about my depression they took it as a joke and told me as usual why would u have depression.They don't understand how desperate I am to have someone say, I love you and I support you just the way you are because you're wonderful just the way you are. They don't understand that I can't remember anyone ever saying that to me.

I’m nearly 20yold and I didn’t achieve shit,unproductive,and afraid asf from my deadly future 
Am going through a bad financial situation i cant find a reliable job
I cant hangout with my friends because of the huge gap between my lifestyle and their’s. I’m scared of having a gf because of how i’m not gonna make her happy and get her everything she wants even though i’m far from getting loved 
I truly want to change because I’m sick of my life 
I need real help 
Sorry for this long ass useless text

Text: I can't do anything no matter what i try. Literally, can't motivate myself to work, can't play video games, barely even have the energy to make this post and it's only bc i know some other people care about me. But life isn't fun. It hasn't been fun for a very long time. I don't know what the purpose of trying is because it never leads anywhere. people keep asking me how i "know" things won't be good but if i don't have a reason to do something in the first place why do i do it?

Doing things i don't want to do requires so much energy, never feels rewarding, and is just so painful. Sometimes it helps other people and that makes me happy. But I'm trying to live for myself and i literally can't because I guess every other human can just robotically perform physical actions without motivation. Small goals don't feel rewarding and holding myself accountable never helps because I don't know why i should care what even i think. I know that's silly but that's literally how empty i am. I can't speak or type or even stand up. I spend hours every day like this.  There's literally no reason to do anything. Antidepressants don't help.

Would like some ideas

Text: because reddit welcome sucks and that you have no help when you begin. the only thing you can try is to post something in a channel that will be automatically removed because you doesn't have enough reputation or karma stuff I don't know . then you end up with the chat room full of bot explaining you that if you are depressed and that you wnat to kill yourself you can post on this channel. That's what I'm doing

Text: Title explains it in tbe most TL;DR way possible, but I'll add another at the end if this ends up too long. Abuse, sexual assault, violence, suicide, self harm, NSFW, and addiction is all mentioned. Tread with care. ._.

Just a little background; I am an 18 year old pre-everything FTM in high school. I live with my parents and my disabled younger brother. 

I almost attempted suicide last night, I guess. A friend talked me through it and helped me fall asleep, but now that I'm awake all the feelings have just come back. I have been "casually suicidal" for like, 2 years at this point and have attempted suicide twice  before. The thing is, I really don't want to die. I just want it all to stop hurting. It's just that nothing I've found so far can make it stop hurting.

I'd just.. really like some advice about where to turn now, that's all. And maybe some validation or support.

A lot of things have happened over the course of my life, and it gets really long. So like I said, I'll add another TL;DR at the end, but here are the events that have lead up to now, listed neatly in chronological order. I have a lot of memory gaps, which I assume is a defense mechanism against trauma, so I will try my best.

Before I was born, my parents (who had met at 12 and 13, and are still married at 41 and 42) were severely abusive to each other. Physical fights, using weapons or objects to harm each other, severe emotional abuse. My mom tells me about a time she kicked my dad down the stairs 3 times while he was drunk, just for fun, and laughed at him each time. She laughed about it as she told the story despite the mortified look on my face. I swear, there's something wrong with her. Both of my parents had really bad home lives growing up, apparently, but my dad especially.

Anyway, my dad was an alcoholic troublemaker who always ended up in juvy, or eventually jail. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever. She ended up in jail pretty often, too. The physical fights stopped after I was born, my dad stopped drinking, and my both parents became law abiding citizens. Occasionally they would throw things at each other, and they still get in screaming matches, but it's nothing like it was before I existed.

I was born a really "gifted" kid; 157 IQ (I know it doesn't matter), really good at everything, scary type of smart, extremely mature for my age. The only thing I wasn't good at (and still am not good at, lol) was prolonged physical activity.

My mom has emotionally abused for my entire life using this fact. She has essentially turned me into a perfectionist and led me to believe that it was my fault, and not hers. She has never accepted anything less than straight A's and perfection, but instead of punishing me like a normal kid (grounding or no allowance or more chores), she would scream at me until she was blue in the face and occasionally beat or shove or throw me, yelling about how I was a disappointment and a failure to her. She emotionally neglected me as well; she never paid attention to me or gave me praise unless I was doing something that  she wanted me to do. She knows nothing about me, and "loves" the image of me she has made. She says I am a waste of money, and makes me feel guilty for needing basic things like food and health care. (We are pretty poor, but I think that is overstepping the line.) She vicariously lives her life through me because she ruined her life at my age; she stayed with my dad and dropped out of college to have me at 22.
This is only a summary of the things she does. It would be much worse if I went into detail.

Nothing I do makes me feel good enough.

I am severely fucked up because of my mom. I have no idea how to maintain healthy relationships, whether it be with friends or romantic partners. I have no self esteem, no self respect, and if I'm honest? I have no personality or sense of self, either. I live with an overlying sense of guilt that I am at fault and that I deserve to be hurt, or worse. I have no hobbies and no interests, and never have. I do not enjoy anything I do in the slightest. To cope with not feeling anything, I have (kinda) reckless sex, hurt myself, and binge drink. I also occasionally smoke weed. The way my mom has treated me has ended up with me being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). After a hospitalization at 15, I was diagnosed with adolescent borderline personality disorder, so I have had it for a while now. Several therapists said I showed all traits by the age of 13 but couldn't diagnose me because of my young age.


Anyways, moving on.


So firstly, I'm living with completely untreated BPD. The nearest specialist is an hour and a half away, and I have really bad insurance. My disability checks were taken away when I turned 18 last year, and my mom gets mad at me when I try to call to ask to fix this. My life is a living hell. I feel nothing at all, but at the same time, I feel everything at once. There is a void that I can't fill no matter how hard I try and I'm in agony. Suicide is always on my mind, every hour of every day. I hurt myself often and binge drink to deal with the stress, or occasionally have reckless unsafe sex or smoke pot.

When I was first brought to therapy, my therapist and psychiatrist had evaluated me for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, and tried to refer me to a specialist. My mom screamed in his face that her perfect child could never be autistic. I have never been evaluated again, but have talked to my school counselor. She says I'm most likely living with untreated ADHD or autism spectrum disorder, but most MOST likely both at once. (My brother, who is emotionally and intellectually disabled, has both of these. So does my dad. It's in my genetics.) I have a hard time focusing on or doing anything, whether it be school or things outside of school. This includes hobbies or being with friends. My grades are piss poor right now, which adds to my guilt and depression. I want to do my work and make my teachers proud, but I haven't been able to focus on/understand the lessons and I lose all of my stuff a lot.

Around the age of 11 or 12, I developed severe anxiety and panic attacks. I was constantly in a state of such anxiety that almost anything could set off a panic attack. I would hyperventilate and cry until I threw up, and would occasionally shit my pants in fear. I was also severely depressed; I had no energy or motivation to do anything. I would hurt myself every day. Around this time I also realized that I had gender dysphoria and was bisexual. I told my mom about all of this, because as a 12 year old you're  supposed to go to your mom about your problems. She shamed me, she blamed me, she screamed at me. I had to threaten to hurt and kill myself to get her to do anything to help me. My panic attacks have since tapered off, and I don't have them as often now.

However, my mom thinks I am not trans and that I am straight. I suppressed both my gender and sexuality for years, but my gender dysphoria has come back tenfold. I'm too scared to tell her but.. I can't live as a woman.

My grades have been pretty not great since 9th grade. I'm really smart still, I just have a really hard time paying attention in class and am too depressed to do my assignments. With enough effort (not much) I can pull A's in most of my classes, and at the  very worst a low B, but nowadays, I don't have the energy to put out that effort anymore. I'm looking at a solid D in every class I have.

I unfortunately have attempted suicide twice. My mom got really angry at me both times and didn't console me in any way. Just blamed me.

I live with constant guilt. Whenever I make a mistake, I hurt myself. Consciously or not. I have scars up and down my arms and all over my fingers from stress-picking, and my shoulders and thighs and stomach are covered in self-harm scars. It does not matter if it's a big mistake or a small mistake. I cannot deal with the guilt of fucking up even a little bit, so I hurt myself to punish myself. It's the only thing that makes me feel a little better when I fuck up.

I have been sexually abused 3 times.

The first instance started at the age of 10 and ended at the age of around 12. My childhood best friend had started acting really strangely, cutting me off for no reason and telling me he hated me and treating me like shit. Essentially, we made a trade; I get to stay friends with him if I send him videos and pictures of myself. He never told me why he started acting this way.

The second time was the worst one. There is serious background to this. I made a new best friend in 4th grade, and we have been super close ever since. We had a mutual crush on each other for years. In 9th grade, I couldn't handle the stress anymore, and set my suicide date as New Years 2017. By some stroke of luck, my best friend invited me to an Xbox party and talked to me all night long and distracted me from killing myself, and we confessed our feelings for each other that night and started dating on January 4th, 2017, during my 9th grade year. We have been together ever since. However, in 10th grade, he admitted to me that he had a fat fetish. I was mortified; I was pretty overweight back then from stress eating, and had no self esteem, but I tried it out because I loved him.

It was horrible. I told him we needed to stop doing that, and that I was going to get fit and lose weight. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldn't love me anymore. I was terrified of being abandoned by the love of my life, and sex was the only form of intimacy I knew at this point, so I didn't want to lose the only things I cared about. I kept doing it for him. It would make me cry and have panic attacks and occasionally throw up, but he didn't stop. I kept telling him that it was okay because I didn't want him to leave me.

I developed severe anorexia because of this. I haven't told anyone about it because I don't want professionals to get rid of it. It's a comfort for me; I need to be as skinny as possible. I cannot be fat or I will kill myself. (I also don't have time to be hospitalized for something like this right now. I am in the midst of scholarship applications and making money for college.)

Now that I am skinny, I am severely paranoid that he loves me less and doesn't like the way that I look. He has admitted both of those things. When he's in a bad mood, he'll insult me about how I'm not sexually good enough for him anymore and that my body is ugly because I'm so skinny. I don't feel good enough, because I clearly am not. He reassures me that he still loves me personality and my face but frankly that's really shitty, if you ask me.

The fat fetish thing doesn't happen anymore, but I'm not good enough for him now.

I'm too scared to leave though. He has been my best friend for like, a decade. I don't want to lose what we've had. This is the biggest problem I face right now aside from the abuse I endure from my mom. This is the reason I had attempted suicide, both times. 

I was drugged and violently raped at a party by one of my friends at 16 while everyone was sleeping. I don't really want to talk about that one. It was just rape, I guess. Uncomfortable situation. It was the least emotionally taxing of the three, though.

I have C-PTSD. I have nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, episodes of dissociation. I throw up or have an episode when people touch me in the wrong places, especially my stomach.

The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I have a beloved ferret named Slinky, and he wouldn't understand where I went if I died. He needs me.

I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't want to die. No treatment I have gone through has ever worked for me. I have been on 3 different SSRIs so far (Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro) and none of them have put a dent in my mood. I have also been on Lamictal, a mood stabilizer. It didn't do anything, and they kept upping the dosage. I had to taper off of it because it was too much for my body to handle, and I would throw it up. I have been kicked out of several facilities for not responding to treatment in any way.

Fortunately, I make a little bit of money. I sell art and I work at my grandfather's gas station down the road.

TL;DR
Mom abused and neglected me to the point of not knowing how to function as a person, I have been sexually abused 3 times which resulted in an eating disorder, I am so mentally ill that I am in agony every day. I have untreated BPD, ADHD, C-PTSD and possibly autism. I have severe anxiety and depression that no treatment can put a dent in. I have been kicked out of several facilities for being completely unresponsive to treatment. I am transgender (FTM), pre-everything, in an unsafe environment, and drowning in dysphoria. I live with so much misdirected guilt from everything that the only things I think about are hurting or killing myself.
And I have to go to college this year.

What the fuck do I do?

Text: The other day one of my friends drunkenly said to me"you look like you're going through some stuff, but don't give up" and I almost started crying. This made me realize that every time someone genuinely asks me how I am, I become really sensitive to the point that I'm almost crying and turn away.

I hate it, what the hell is wrong with me, and it feels impossible to actually talk about it, I indirectly told my parents and was able to get medication, but it's simply not good enough, I am going to the doctor in a few days and see if I can get anything stronger

Text: I have this close female friend who I like but I know probably doesn’t like me in a romantic way. I’ve asked before, and she turned me down. But she’s probably the person I’m closest too and who I trust the most in the world. But I figure she doesn’t see a future with me because I don’t have a career or because I’m still hung up on my ex. And I can’t go to Facebook or Snapchat anymore because it either gets misunderstood and I get messaged with concern, or I get completely ignored and feel rejected from it. I don’t know. It really does feel like as a guy I can only be loved and sought after if I give some or create something that gets people’s attention. I’m not loved or sought after for who I am. That’s why I’m alone right now in my life, why I seem to be unsuccessful at dating or meeting people. It sucks because that feels like the way for me to get out of this funk (that and seeking God). I just don’t want another person to tell me to be happy alone, or to tell me to let go. The thing I’ve wanted was for someone unprompted to tell me that I mattered to them, that I make their life better by being me. I’ve told myself those things, but it fades away when I have less to show for a life I don’t want to be living, because I can’t right now make things come true or be the only one believing I have a future that seems impossible.

Text: I have been suffering from depression i suppose all my life. However, acknowledgment of it only came 3-4 years ago. Since acknowledging i have depression, each passing year since I get worst and worst. These last two years have been my lowest with contemplation of harm getting harder to ignore. 

My 30th birthday was earlier this year and 4 days leading to it the idea of not seeing that birthday was painfully strong. I have no social life. the one friend that i confided in, that relationship has drastically changed. I have no romantic life, and havnt dated in 6 years. and i have no career, recently quitting my job as my mental health plumited, however now i dont think i am good enough for any job so the motivation to look just brings about anxiety and self hate. 

Note that i have been on lexapro for the last 5 months with my dossage being raised last week, and although it helps regulate my moods a littler better, I am still incredibly sad and hate the pathetic state of my life. I also started therapy the same time i got the perscription and see them one a week. However, although talking out my feelings gives me temporary relief i still dont know the tools needed to be better. 

I am incredible lonely and don’t want to feel this heaviness and self hatred anymore.

I guess the reason for my post is to find out if anyone has genuinely overcome their depression to the point that they can say they are truly happy. Or is this something I will have to fight with for the rest of my life, because if it is then what is the point?

Text: Often times I just feel down and I have no clue why. Like I have friends and a supporting family but I barely talk to any of them when I’m feeling down. Just an hour I talked to a friend i meet online and she told me to try new routines and try to change my mind set from “everything right now is useless and nothing matters” to something else she never told me. But the thing Is that I can’t just change my mind set and that makes me even more sad because I tell myself I can’t be better and almost everyone are better than me. 

But when I meet someone that isn’t better than me I say bad things and push them away to make them feel worse. 

Also recently I find myself starring into nothing or a mirror and just thinking what would happen if I would die and who honestly would care. Also also when I think about this sort of stuff I don’t cry or do anything physical like that I just get sad and keep thinking.

Text: I’ve always liked video games, and always had the thought that not much in the real world really felt worth it or like it would do much for me, but a lot of the time even video games just feel like a distraction. Same with people. I can appreciate a lot of things, but don’t really expect them to fill me with much of a sense of joy or something. 

They say relationships are the biggest predictors of happiness, and even though I love my family I almost don’t know if I feel it. I just feel the pain at the thought of losing them or if they lost me.

It’s like I am only driven by moving away from pain and pleasure is fleeting if at all possible. Until recently I thought I was completely emotionally numb from medication but I’m trying to entertain the idea it’s OCD and depression that makes me like this, because that’s more fixable.

I feel like when thinking of hobbies, or jobs, or things to devote my life too I just ask myself but why would I do this over anything else?

Text: I'm at rock bottom. I've been crying all day. My eyes are swollen. I barely have the strength to write this. It's going to be nonsensical, I'm sorry. I am so completely alone. I don't have any friends. It's the same thing over and over. If I don't push away my own friends, they'll push me me away eventually. I've tried making friends, I've tried so fucking hard, but I can't connect with anyone it seems. My heart is hurting right now. I wish I could die. I don't know what I'm expecting out of this post. I'll probably get nothing anyways, in a flood of other much more important posts. I don't know. I just want to disappear so badly. I'm so tired of being alone. J can't take it anymore. I guess I'm just looking for something. Fucking anything. Please. I'm fucking begging someone out there. Help me

Text: I really need tips for helping support my bf when he has his bad days. His days come in waves of really highs until one day everything comes crashing down and gets really bad for a few days before turning around and slowly getting better until the cycle repeats. I know he’s falling into depression and I’ve mentioned therapy but he claims “therapy doesn’t help for this.” I know he’s very lonely and feels as though he has nothing to do besides eat, work, and sleep because he’s new to the area he lives in. He says everything bad happens to him and he just feels empty and useless. How do I help show him how special he is and support him without constantly nagging him to seek therapy? How would you want your gf to help you when you don’t live in the same city?

Text: Hello reddit. I don’t know if I’m lazy or depressed, but over the past few weeks I’ve been feeling empty. I feel so emotionally numb and I started to lose interest in things I used to enjoy, like playing video games. I’m in high school, and I’m so overwhelmed by homework because of the pressure that I have to do them perfectly. So much that I just don’t want to do anything at all. My parents call me lazy, but I really don’t know if that’s true.

So I looked up what depression was, and I was like “yep, I probably have this”, but my mind is going back forth from thinking I’m depressed or faking it. It’s confusing because I’m still able to carry out tasks like chores, but at the same time I feel like I only do it because I have to. 

I also easily get upset over little things, like when my parents try to lecture me. It reminds me that I’m a failure. A bad child. And I’ll never be enough for anyone. Then I start beating myself up because of it, because that was my only coping mechanism. I would just punch my own arm or hand to release that energy. It hurts, but I don’t care.

I can still enjoy some things, like painting. But eventually that enjoyment goes away, and I go back to that feeling. I ruminate over past social interactions, and I just sit down and do nothing. I’ve always been tired and lacked energy, but I think it’s because I don’t get much sleep. But another thing is, I get hyper around my friends, which is why I have these conflicting thoughts about depression. Sometimes, I would unexpectedly start to fidget and do everything quickly, but that energy goes away when I’m alone. My mood goes up a but all those thoughts and feelings come back eventually.

I cannot afford therapy, nor want my parents to be involved. I’m not an adult yet either, but I feel like I need help. Does this sound like depression? If not, then what is it?

Text: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. We both have had our struggles with depression. Recently I see he has been feeling down once again. He doesn’t want to go to a therapist because “ he knows what’s wrong, he just doesn’t have the motivation to do anything about it.” in his exact words:
“I don’t want to go to therapy because I see therapy as guidance method for improvement. I don’t feel like I need guidance, my problem is one of will and circumstance, I don’t doubt that I could benefit from it, but right now I see it as going out of my way to do something I don’t prioritize” 
Even though we’ve been together a while, he still does not feel comfortable opening up to me about how he is feeling. I’ve asked him ways that I can help him feel better, or support him and he says that talking about it won’t make him feel better. Is there anything I can do to help him? I hate seeing him be down like this and be unable to help him. I’ve also tried giving him space and left him alone for a bit. Am I being selfish for trying to help him? Are there other things I should try to help him feel better? Any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated

Text: Depression is ruining my life

I’m 18 soon and I hate myself. I was diagnosed with depression in July and I’m just worthless. All my mates are going out and having fun and going to university and Im going anywhere in my life. I feel like I’ve wasted my youth away not doing anything whilst everyone else is living it till the fullest. I can’t attract women, I’ve been told that I’m attractive by quite a lot of girls but I just can’t seem to attract them and I don’t know what it is. The past just haunts the **** out of me and I feel I have nothing to live for and I contemplate suicide a lot. I’m a lazy cowardly stupid human being who’s done nothing with their life Thank You

Text: I’ve been hesitant to post honestly. I see how many people have it so much worse than me. But I feel like I’ve hit a new low lately. I’ve lost my job, my fiancé left me, I’m unable to work because of health issues (why I lost my job) and my “friends” only want me around when they need mechanic work done (I’ve been a mechanic since 18, I’m now 24) I’ve done everything I can to stay positive. But every time I turn around, something I enjoy and love is being taken out of my hands and I feel like there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m sorry if like, these problems seem minuscule compared to others. I just, really have no where else to go. And I’m honestly scared. I have bad dreams every night and they keep me awake. I just, don’t know what to do anymore

Text: I know what I need to be happy. I need to stop smoking weed, I need to exercise, I need to eat better, to get on a good sleep schedule, to talk to people more, to actually open up to my therapist, to clean my house and do all of my work. I’ve done it all before and I’ll do it again. But I always end up back here. Square one. Unfortunately for me I stay at square one for months and I have like a few good weeks sometimes where I’m doing better but it always spirals downhill to the point where I can’t do anything and I lose all motivation. I’m just too depressed. I know the mindset I need to have, I know I need to believe in myself, to focus on the positive, take my meds every day. I’ve been doing those things...but nothing works. I don’t want to spend my life like this but I don’t know what else to do. Sometimes I cannot physically bring myself to do things or complete tasks. It’s just too much. So what do I do?

Text: Depression hurts.  I know this, took years to work mine out.  I’m mostly stable now but hubs is struggling.  Been to a couple therapists over the years but never really had any success/found one he could connect to. The few meds he tried made him worse.  He holds it together pretty well most times.  But when he drops he pushes everyone away, yells, and gets very defeatist; it hurts. I often find myself saying and doing the wrong things and making it worse.  I have the kids go to their room and be quiet. Sometimes I get mad at his behavior until it sinks in what his brain is doing. I apologize but it doesn’t take the pain away.  I don’t know how to help him.  I suggest therapy but he poo poo’s me.  He’s getting worse and I’m worried. Advice welcomed.

Text: (F19) I won't sugar coat it, I've been depressed and suicidal for years now and it just keeps getting worse. I so badly want to work on my health, mindfulness etc... to maybe bring myself out of this very bad episode I've been in for a while. I sit around all day thinking about either taking my life or finding some way to change myself, but I have nothing in me to actually do it. I walk my dog everyday but even when I'm out I am in a fog. I have insanely bad self esteem. I'm so self destructive, but inside I don't want to be. My family has gotten tired of me, so I don't even talk about it anymore. I've tried therapy and one kind of meds, neither helped very much. I feel really angry at myself. 

Where do I start? I'm so lost.

Text: I started a new job after being looked over by other employers, I'm negative in my account and was barely able to pay my rent due to the incredible generosity of my uncle giving me a loan. I don't think I'm ever going to achieve my dreams, I don't need to be some big name like Elon or Gates. I just want to provide something to this Earth. I want to plant stuff to help nature heal, or provide for a community, f**k just have a place I can go help people so I feel like I have meaning. I know I have the potential for so much more than what I'm doing and where I'm at but I just can't seem to find a path, or the right path for me. I'm so overwhelmed with the weight of everything, feeling like a disappointment or like I'm failing as a man. I just want to help, put some good in the world to maybe cancel how shitty I can be to people I don't even know.

Text: I feel like Im drowning. The past couple days I finally felt better... last night it hit me like a ton of bricks. I cant stop crying. It took all the energy I had to go to get coffee and lunch today... even that i took a couple bites and put leftovers up. I just want to crawl in a hole. I'm so fucking alone. I can't be open to anyone when my depression gets bad because my whole life if it was bad my family thought I was just wanting attention. I feel like a burden and a waste of space.

Text: I started antidepressant for the first time two days ago. The first day I got a bit of euphoria. But by the second day I couldn't get out of bed, didn't shower or anything. Took my second does, started feeling weird like nausea, headache and altogether an unsettling feeling. Couldn't sleep at night but then I spent the whole day in bed. After my mom bugged me a lot I got up and brushed my teeth by late evening. I feel like crying, I haven't eaten anything. I don't want to shower, I just want to stay in bed.

I thought antidepressants were supposed to make you feel good. I feel awful, completely awful. My antidepressant is a combination of clonazepam and escitalopram. What should I do?

Text: Recently my boyfriend (the only person I’ve talked to about my seasonal depression) told me that he thinks I’m too emotionally dependent on him. I understand why he says that (as previously stated he’s the only person I’ll talk to) and I understand that he said it because he’s worried. But it makes me feel like I can’t talk to him either anymore. 

I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to be emotionally dependent on someone but I can’t do this alone either. I’ve cried myself to sleep so many times since he told me, I’ve wanted to self harm again so badly, and I can’t talk about it to anyone. I tried telling him that I just feel worse and all he said was “I don’t know what to say”. 

I guess my reaction to what he said just proves that I am emotionally dependent on him but I just need someone I trust to talk to, but recently my best friend has become someone I barely recognize. I don’t have anyone else to talk to, now I don’t have anyone. 

I recently made an appointment to go see one of my college’s guidance councillors, but I haven’t had my appointment yet. I guess I’ll see what comes of that...

Text: I feel overwhelmed at the slightest things. This has been happening for a long, long time but it just keeps getting worse. Some days are better than others. Today is a bad day.

I quite my job in January to “live my dream” of being a full-time artist. I am failing so hard. Yes, COVID really impacted everything but if I’m being completely honest, I was never cut out for this to begin with. I’ve taken on commissioned work that is months overdue because the thought of starting is so overwhelming. I keep telling myself, “tomorrow I will start” and I feel relieved.

I wanted to make art today (first time in months) and even got excited at the idea of going to the art store, but then I just thought “it will just be another piece that sits there and goes unfinished”. I killed all of my excitement before I even did anything. This isn’t me. I used to love to create art more than anything and spent almost every spare second painting.

I haven’t started and I feel guilt and shame everyday. I feel stuck. I can’t start and I feel like absolute shit for my behaviour.

I also “run” an online vintage shop. I built the new website back in February and was SO proud and excited about it. I haven’t touched it since. I want to, I want to work on it, but now I have SO many pieces of clothing that need to be cleaned, photographed, listed, measured, that it’s- again....overwhelming. I can’t bring myself to start and just look at all the beautiful clothing just sitting there every single day.

Some days I scroll through my phone for hours because I’m looking for a sign or a solution. I’m wasting my life. I hate feeling this way. I hate living this way. I’m unhappy no matter what I do and I’m feeling SO much guilt for letting so many people down. 

I’m 30 years old- too old to be acting this way. It’s so shameful. I also keep thinking that it’s too late for me to make any changes. What’s the point in trying to do better if I haven’t already figured it out by now. I’ve been feeling this way for at least 2 years and keep waiting for some magical answer that will turn everything around.

Again, I have good days too but today isn’t one of them. Thanks for letting me vent.

Text: So I’m a 17 year old guy and I was supposed to graduate high school this May but I decided to graduate early back in February because I had a really toxic high school experience I have a physical disability so people just harassed me or used me for personal gain by manipulating me. I live in this really small town where there is nothing to do unless you want to be stuck in life etc. anyways back to the point I got a job because I wanted to save money for college this fall and at this point this job is my distraction from my current state even though the job is boring I try to make the best of it my parents are selling our current house soon and are moving to the city and I just keep telling myself it will get better when we move but at this point I really don’t know anymore I’m stuck in a horrible town that there’s nothing for me there I have no friends and I’m stuck at a really boring job and I just don’t know what to do with myself and I hate it I want Chan so bad this chapter of my life is over and I’m ready to move on but I’m currently stuck and it’s slowly just making me more and more depressed

Text: I'm so lonely. I just moved to another country with my boyfriend. It's a non English speaking country and I'm feeling so incredibly alone. My boyfriend immediately got a job and he's working long hours, meanwhile I'm at home alone just waiting for him to come back.

I've had depression and anxiety for years and years, it was slowly getting better but I still had my rough days from time to time. I feel like a complete failure, and I feel so stupid for hoping that this move would make me feel better. 

I feel like an imposter and like I don't belong anywhere. I don't deserve to be anywhere or have any chances in life because there are so many better people out there than me. 

I'm so terrified of looking of looking for a job that I just keep putting it off. I have no desirable skills, I can't speak the language. Who in their right mind would employ me?

I was honestly doing so well for the first month since I got here, loving the country and just feeling fresh and new.  I posted on an expat subreddit for the country I've moved to (on a different account) with a question I had, because I honestly had no idea where else to ask it. 

I tried so hard to phrase the question in the best, clearest, most polite way possible, because I was worried about being a burden. 

There were a few people who answered my question and were helpful but it got downvoted a lot, because someone reposted my post on a different subreddit made for making fun of people. And the repost got so many upvotes. It had people in the comments calling me retarded, and a fuckwit and stupid and just generally shitting on me.

I wish I never posted anything, I'm probably going to regret posting this as well. I'm so completely crushed. I've never been bullied this badly before. I don't trust anyone anymore. I've used this new account to post this because I'm so terrified of these people following me around on any different posts I make.

I really thought that it was going to be a nice community. I wanted to make friends and get advice from people in the same situation as me. But now it feels like everyone is just a huge jerk, and I'm the worst person in the world for daring to move to "their" country. (They're expats too!) 

It's making me feel so terrible. I haven't been able to get out of bed for days. I wake up in the night sobbing. I've stopped eating. I feel like I'm not wanted in this country. I'm feeling so stupid for thinking that moving here was a good idea. 

I feel stupid for being upset about it too. They were calling me a "snowflake" for just calmly asking about how to do a simple thing I didn't know how to do. So me being upset just proves them right. Everything they said about me is just the truth. I say it to myself everyday anyways. 

I feel bad telling my boyfriend how I feel because he works really hard all day, and comes home late and really tired. I don't want to bother him by complaining about my problems. I've already talked a lot with him about it all, and he's really good at trying to make me feel better and listening to me. But I just feel so guilty, so I keep a lot of it in. And I don't want to message my family back home because I don't want them to worry. It's my first time living out of home. I don't want to make my problems anyone elses problems. 

I even feel guilty posting here. I'm just so pathetic. Dramatic. fuck i hate myself.

I don't even have enough karma on this account, so this is probably just going into the void. But at least its out of my brain. 

Sorry for rambling, I don't know what else to do.

Text: But it seems like I’ve been crying out for help from every point I’ve tried to make, and no one is interested in helping me the way I’ve asked.  

&gt;&gt;Forget veterans employment allocation program

&gt;&gt;Forget education/employment pipelines

&gt;&gt;Forget Criminalizing American Political Discrimination.  



I just wanted to become a fucking professional opera singer, and I wanted help from others making that a reality, after 20 years of working towards it alone weren’t doing anything to make it a reality.  And it seems like nobody cares if it kills me that no matter how hard I’ve tried to achieve that goal, I’ve always come up short on my own, while everybody else makes themselves a part of these segregating communities against me.

So tonight I’m contemplating wether I ought to swim out into the middle of the lake and end it all.   Nobody wants to help me when I’ve asked for help.  Nobody wants to implement alternative solutions when I’ve tried to present them to people.  Nobody wants to even touch me, let alone care if I’m on the cusp of deciding to end my life.   

I don’t want to go swimming at the lake tonight.  But it seems like nobody wants to stop me because they care.  They only want to stop me to save face, and I can’t pull myself back when they want to stop me for reasons as selfish as why I want to end my life tonight.  So why should I stop for their benefit when they won’t help me for mine?

Text: I feel lonely and melancholy. I know I should have gone for a swim today on my day off, but I didn't. I know I could've called one of my friends or family members, but I didn't. I know I could've done some batch cooking today, but I didn't. I know I could've read some novels  or practised my language skills today, but I didn't. I didn't even read any magazines. I couldn't be bothered to do anything.

I have too many days like this. I've had too many of them over the course of nearly 4 decades (yes, I'm getting old). My life is being dawdled away.

Most of the time, I can kick myself into doing what I need to do to keep a roof over my head, keep my few close relationships alive, honour what I feel are my duties, not fall apart entirely...but I feel like I'm going mouldy.

I've kept my life simple and quiet. I've done little with it. I've messed up a bit. I've done some things adequately. I've given some people some moments of love and happiness.

I feel lucky to be alive but frustrated at the same time. It's odd.

Text: Hi everyone, I suffer from depression dependent on low dopamine levels.  I have already tried the bupripion at 450mg but it hasn't worked except for a very short period.  I have lived with this problem for years and if I don't find a solution I will evaluate euthanasia.  the ssri do nothing but exacerbate my symptoms.  I lost my job, I sleep all day because of poor physical and mental energy.  I have chronic fatigue,  cognitive difficulties , memory problem , difficulty concentrating.  I have lost libido.  I don't have any other type of pathology or deficiency, I don't have hormonal, thyroid, autoimmune, inflammatory problems.  I have already tried: reboxetine, moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, amisulpride, tianeptine, modafinil, sulbutiamine, bupropion, vortioxetine, sertraline, piracetam, aniracetam.  modafinil I had to stop it because it caused me heart problems.  what the heck should i use to increase dopamine?  I have absolutely no intention of using cocaine or amphetamine i don't want to destroy my brain more .  help me damn it

Text: How do you cope with knowing that depression is a mental illness/state that never really gets “cured” or goes away? How do you cope with knowing that you’ll never be at peace or happy? I’m struggling a lot with this. I’m trying to work on it in therapy, but it feels very much like the dark cloud will never recede and I’ll always be going through life with a sense of dread covering everything I do. How can I ever be satisfied with simply managing or coping instead of really progressing and finding a good stable place to be? I’m constantly dreading what’s coming or feeling guilty at the things I’ve failed to do in the past and it feels never ending and hopeless.

Text: All week I have been depressed at some point. For a while I was able to take this meaningless life of never ending work, but after 2 months of my boss working as many 12 hour days as he could to pay for his weeding, I can't keep my depression aways anymore. 

Please some kind of help, something. I know that nothing is free, but I just need something beyond promises of hope or things will get better.

Text: Hi I’m 38 and male.  I had a divorce 6 months ago.  The divorce was not my choice , but relatively friendly , I don’t see the point of staying with someone who doesn’t want to be with you.  But in a way that made it even worse .. because it just feels like she gave up on our relationship.

Since then I’ve gotten more and more depressed.  I’m originally from Costa Rica , but studied and worked in the US where I was very successful .  When I was 32 I decided to move back because I wanted to start a family in a place with more permanence and better work-life balance.  In order to do that I took a very big paycut and work at a job that isn’t really that challenging for me.  Everything made sense when I was getting married , but now I’m divorced, we didn’t have kids ( a big part of the break-up despite no medical reason for it , and both of us trying ) , and I feel like a professional failure when I compare myself to my friends and family who continued their career path.  I’m turning 40 in a year and a half and I just feel like I wasted all my 30s.  

I’m having a really hard time planning for the future , I just don’t have any goals anymore and feel like I can’t get excited for anything . 

If I think about things objectively I know I have options .   I can try to change jobs maybe get a second masters and get a two year work visa to the US or Europe to get back into the workforce .

But I have no energy or motivation , maybe I’m just afraid of trying and failing again.  Part of me just wants to give - up.  Don’t know what to do , I feel stuck .

Text: Hi, so I'm not sure if I'm right here, but my boyfriend is having a severe depression since he is maybe 14. He is getting help since one year and takes serious dose of medication. We've known each other since eight month. He is lovely, he is just the right guy for me and in my eyes he is perfect. He actually is always tired, in this state most of you probably know, but I think he is getting a little better. 
Only he has those phases where you just feel nothing and at the same time kind of despair and don't have any self-worth and I can't find the right words really. I hope you know what I mean. Well I don't know what to do. I always offer him to talk to me and say what he currently is feeling, only if he wants to of course, but he just says that since it is the same thing every time he just needs to get through it. I don't know if that is good for his mental state this believe, because I think he thinks he is troubling me by talking about this, but it is not. I have told him that I will listen even if it is the same thing every time and that he does NOT waste my time! Still I feel really helpless if he is in this state of mind and I'm not even sure if I should say anything. And if you guys can tell me if there is anything you would like someone to say, do for you when you are in this state of mind, could you tell me? Maybe that will help me to say the right words, or show him my support the right way or that I should just leave him pass through it.. 

I of course realise that everyone in their depression is different and that there is not *the* right way, still maybe it helps.

Text: I'm told i have social anxiety and depression. I talked to my doctor and he says i could start taking antidepressants, like prozac etc. I used to be neutral towards medication, but now i just want to function like a normal human being and still I'm not sure if it'll work or it'll be worth it. 

I did a bit research how prozac affects people, negative/positive. And now I just feel so confused. is it worth the risk, some people say 'wish i never took it' and some are just grateful. My family is already against those kind of medications but i turned 18 lately so it'll be my decision.

I will have to study for university exam this year and i can't even imagine myself studying. i just don't feel like doing anything. i feel like i don't even care anything enough. and doctor says it'd help with all this exam stress too, that i could study better etc. says it has so little side effect and it's not addictive. says I'd have to use them nearly 1/2 or 1 year to it affect me positively. 

i just don't know what to do right now and feel confused

Text: Please don't try to convince me to try more meds or therapy. I've been trying for 12 years to find something that works and I'm just 23. I've also been to different therapists and have tried many types of therapy, the most recent ones being systematic therapy and CBT. Nothing has worked so far. I have stopped looking for a cure, I know it doesn't exist. But I need new ways to cope with my depression because my old coping techniques are no longer working.

I have tried meditation too but seems like it does nothing for me. The only ways I could cope with my depression were doing something creative like painting or drawing and listening to music. I no longer enjoy creating things and listening to music and I've been left without hope because every day I keep getting worse and there's no way for me to cope with my depression anymore. So here's the question, what do you guys do when you feel like doing nothing besides sleeping? I am literally not in the mood for doing anything and it's tearing me apart because I've spent the last few months of my life just being a leech and a parasite and doing nothing and it's taking a toll on my mental health that's already damaged badly enough. I need help. Forcing myself to do these things doesn't help either.

Text: So first time ever posting on Redditt so sorry if I mess up. So today is my birthday and it’s honestly just been the worst day ever. I usually just stay home and play video games or spend the day with my daughter. But today was terrible. So my brother invited me to have a little party at his house I thought ok this will be a good thing. Well once I got there I found out I had to cook all the food and also my own birthday cake which is ok I guess maybe I’m just being picky? But then my boyfriend starts a fight with me because I went when I thought he didn’t remember and he didn’t have anything planned so I ruined that as well. So now I’m sitting in my bathroom in tears because my brother said that I’m just being sensitive and stupid and then my boyfriend is saying that I ruined everything. Like what did I do wrong today for it to be my birthday I didn’t get to do anything I wanted at all. Maybe I’m just being silly over nothing? I dunno know maybe I did ruin everything for everyone.

Text: My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I go to my mom’s house weekdays, my dad’s weekends.

The main issue I have with my dad is that I simply can’t trust him. I can’t open up to him without him rejecting my opinion. Growing up with him has made me feel helpless, and living with him feels like giving him all the control. He has threatened to take my phone because I said I value emotional relationships more than comfortable living. He threatened to go to court and call the police if I refused to go to his house. I said I wouldn’t mind going for dinner and such, but he outright rejects my opinions.
He said it wasn’t my choice, and that just proves my point where I can’t trust him to respect my feelings.
He knows I have depression. He says he’s willing to change, but I don’t have the mental capacity to live with him if he doesn’t change by himself.

I live in BC Canada, so the age requirement for choosing who to live with is 19, but I researched about it and it said that the court will mostly decide for the child’s best interest. I’m terrified of the slightest possibility that my dad will win custody. At that point, I might as well kill myself.
My dad is a negative influence, a toxic personality. I cut out most toxicity from my life because it’s caused me to be depressed, and it’s why I don’t want to see him again.
I’m trying to compromise but I can’t live with him. I just feel upset and terrified right now.

Text: Yesterday night I was texting a friend (i had a few drinks) and ended up telling him about my dark thoughts. I don’t even know him that well, but at the time it was so easy. 

He was real kind and nice about it, and reassured me it was good to talk. But waking up today I just felt worse. I haven’t gotten out of bed and we’re well into the afternoon. 

I texted today, but no response. Maybe it was all a mistake. Maybe I shouldn’t burden people with my problems. I’ve always kept em to myself, why not now?

Text: So basically, today in college we had a 15 minute break and my mate and I went out of college we went to the shops. We came back at the end of the break and as soon as we walked in this girl said "speaking of the devil. We were just speaking about you" and she was saying about my mate. I sat down on my seat and I got a message from my mate telling me that they were chatting shit about me, these two girls. They were going on about how I was ugly and how I can't get any girls and stuff. It didn't bother me about what they said, but should I have said something back, I'm not really looking for drama especially right now where I have a situation going on with a girl. I just want some advice on what I should've done or next time if I catch them talking about me. By the way, I didn't say anything to them girls, they said this randomly. Also, I am not a player or anything either so I don't know why she would have said that.

Text: A few years ago, a really bad breakup turned into a long term depressive episode, and I lost all interest in the very few passions in life that define me. 
I spend a lot of time really missing being in love with what I used to do the way I previously was-- from time to time I even have the tendency to try to push myself into giving it another spin. But every time I try, it feels like a job, and all motivation and determination I have gets sucked straight out of me. 
I just want to love doing music again, because I've been such a bland, shell of a person since I suddenly fell out of it. Does anyone experience such extreme loss of passion and interest in big things in your life? How do you cope? It's been 3 years and I'm struggling still, and I'm honestly losing hope that I'll ever really love something that much again . :(

Text: It's currently 4 am, I have work in 4 hours, and I don't know what to do, I am in so much pain but I can't cry or express myself and all I want to do is cut until I actually feel something. I've been trying to tell my family and friends I need help but it's falling on deaf ears and I can't fucking stop acting like I'm okay or 'just tired'. They all think I've gotten better but I'm not, I'm scared one day I'm going to just give in to my thoughts and am terrified I am going to lose my job If I don't go to work tomorrow or mess up if I do. I work in a medical environment and I don't think it's safe for anyone for me to be there in my mental state and lack of sleep.

Text: Feels like everyday my life gets a bit worse. Everyday I find a way to fk it up more somehow, I find a way to disappoint loved ones or just people in general. Today the day was livable so far, I was happy having my classes and I get the news that a friend I chat to daily has to stop chatting with me so often because his partner doesn't like the fact that we chat so often????? Like???? I can't believe this, we are friends, if anything I'd say platonic friends, I don't know what to do, I just had my whole day and mental ruined by 5 voice messages and it's just adding up to me wanting to end my fkn life even more. Some background, I'm a very needy person I'm the type of person to always reply instantly because I'm always checking for friends messages because I feel without them I'm unhappy, I love having someone giving me their attention all day, might sound toxic but so be it, I'm nothing without friends either way.
Well I don't know what else to say I can't think straight right now either I'm so emotional I can't even reply back to my friends, I'm lost

Text: Okay hi im new here.
I just want to know if im really a bad person for doing what i did.
I worked at a bar. And i served more or less men that only ask about sex and annoying stuff like that ( im a girl btw)my boss is like 23 y/o and at the start things were okay but at the end i was the only one cleaning around the place and the people liked me the most (or so they say) and today she told me its all my fault why everything has gone to shit. That she and the other girl that works there have families and houses to look after etc.
And that i dont have it that bad in life 
( i started not wanting to go to work anymore cuz i had a depressive episode for like a month straight) i hated working there. I wasnt this depressed i  years. I was at my lowest point. I did not want to leave my bed let alone work with people that would only drive me more insaine.
So. Am i just dumb and should suck it up and just work? Im so confused. I feel bad for quiting that job but i really didnt like it.
I just felt so bad that everything was my fault again.

Text: Hello, that's my first post ever on reddit.

I am in huge trouble and I put myself there now I need to face this but I don't know what to do.

I always had panic attacks and alot of stress since I was just a child. but when I started university it doubled and I came to the point last year where I couldn"t get out of bed, let alone study.  I closed myself off and didn't get out of my room for a month, That had consequences on my grades and that made me hate myself even more. 

I used to be very disciplined, a grade A student so that felt like a punch to the guts.Anyway, this year I have a graduation project I need to work on. I thought I learned from that past experience but I really didn't.I was procrastinating out of fear for 5 months now. whenever I start I just start trembling and can't concentrate on anything I'm reading. that led me to withdraw from poeple, my teacher my friends because I'm too ashamed of my behaviour and I can't face them. 

I'm in deep shit I want to get out of this but I don't know how.   This is not how I thought my life and my view towards myself turn out .

PS: I was taking medications for anxiety and for depression but I stopped them now .

Text: I am a master student that study abroad. I had miscalculation on financial stuff and everyone in my new country is very individualistic. So they told me to find my own way and I got unlucky met some horrible people and I got PTSD for awful events.

Every time I asked people at the university or government what should I do to fix my problem. They told me to find a friend if I could not figure it out by myself.

The problem is most people here don't make a new friend after high school.  

A new friend won't help me to do stuff. I should get a close friend because I keep getting the answer you can use google or I cannot help you. 

I don't like to go to a party or bar. I am too depressed to do fun stuff.

I am tired with a suggestion about joining student association because I did that and I only met students that only want for FWB. And female students mostly busy with their boyfriend.

So I thought I need to find boyfriend too because no one wants to make a new friend.

My psychologist told me to find an online friend. However, when I told my problem to people that I met online in my the new country, most people would reply with, "You should search people in real life" or "You seems put lots of chores to your friend" or "You should stop searching for boyfriend".

I know people my new country is famous for being rude and direct. But I'm still don't know what should I do. I usually only ask like translation or things like guidance if I have a certain condition.

I just need support and was wondering if support is too much to ask for people in the western country?

Text: How do people find/keep a job when they’re depressed and/or struggling with debilitating mental illness? I apply to so many jobs &amp; I have bills to pay. I’m basically out of money this month after leaving my previous job. I even left that job due to feeling so inadequate, the inability to just get the fuck out of bed, among all of the other things/feelings that come with being so trapped in my own head it feels like. 

I feel like I need somebody to slap me into reality. I don’t understand how people can continue to show up to these jobs that they hate every single day. I don’t know how people bite back their fear of looking fucking dumb. I try so hard to be a functioning member of society but I’m failing so hard. I don’t know how to swallow that pill &amp; I feel so underprepared for adulthood. I’ve been depressed and struggling with this for so many years now. It really started in adolescence, around 13-14. I’m 23 now and feel like such a damn failure knowing that I haven’t changed much at all since then. 

If anybody has any advice or comments that may help me would be really appreciated because I don’t know what to do at this point. Thank you in advance.

Text: So I have been depressed all of my life as long as I can remember. I didn't really know what its like to not have that sinking, dreadful feeling in my heart. That is -until I met my current boyfriend. He makes me feel alive and happy again. He pulled me out of the darkness I was so deep in. But I can feel myself starting to slip again, and I'm trying so hard to not let it drag me down. I used to self harm, and I promised him I'd try as hard as I could to not do it again. For like 3 weeks before the present one, I was completely absolutely numb. I didn't laugh, didn't cry, didn't feel anything at all. It was the worst feeling in my life, It felt like I just died and had no soul or heartbeat, but worse. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through it again. But after about three weeks of feeling that way, I self-harmed, partially to prove I could still feel something. And for some reason, I didn't feel the sadness I usually do when I relapse. I just felt *alive*. And I slipped out of that terrible numb feeling. I feel alive now, and still numb, but not as bad as before. But the problem is, I've slipped into a different type of numbness. It's like I don't care about anything anymore. I have 3 grades below a 50, and I really don't have the energy or motivation to care, even though I want to. I honestly wouldn't care If i just got hit by a truck or like had a heart attack, but its not like i'm gonna go out of my way to make it happen. I want to stop this before it slips too deep but I don't know how.

Text: Im (28m) shes (49f)There's a lot of backstory here so ill try to sum up some main points for context. My mother has substance abuse issues all through my life. It caused me to live with my grandparents multiple timea in my life from 3-6 then again from 11-16 til my grandmother died and i had nowhere else to go. I ended up living with her due to some medical issues for myself at the time i had to drop out of school.and get my GED and a job. She made me pay rent 250 a month full time 40 hours a week back then i was making roughly 280 dollars a week. Whatever pay rent no problem even though Id be more supportive of my kid going through a terrible time but whatever. I also had to pay for my own food and such.The problem was a lot. My room was storage for her and her boyfriend i literally had just a bed and the rest were boxes of junk the boyfriend who was a hoarder didnt want to throw out. On top of that he was a terrible person who would constantly bad mouth my mother, steal my weed and other things from my room(i actually caught him on camera and showed him and he still denied it to my face.) One day he did it in front of me and i beat the shit outta him and i ended up leaving and sleeping on friends couches etc. Now at the time I would've fucking killed for my mother. So her picking him over me kinda broke my heart back then but it is what it is. Fast forward a couple years(20) i ended up living back with her doing the same stuff but this time at least i had a room that didnt have junk in it. But the abusive boyfriend was still there and it was the same pay rent and.  all of my food. She starts letting her friends from the methadone clinic she goes too stay in the house...for FREE🤦‍♂️. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, that's not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didn't contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i can't talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasn't that great. Yeah that's fucking terrible and all that but that doesn't excuse your decision for you children. You're supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place I'm in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she don't understand that I'm busy even though i told her this. Honestly she's the reason for a lot of my depression. it sucks having to coddle a parent, i have no guidance i feel lost half the time and she will never understand that.

Text: Posting on a throwaway for a lot of reasons. I’m numb to the pain, I wake up late because I’m basically a bum who doesn’t work and goes to online school. I bought a gym membership but get super unmotivated to go. It all started last year when I got laid off from my job at Disney due to covid, and the transition to online school. Ever since March of last year I’ve been in my room all alone, my family worries and it’s so rare I leave my room sometimes they think I went out to eat. The only friends I got are my girlfriend and a friend from high school who I keep tabs with, he’s the last person I wanna talk to about this shit. My parents don’t exactly hate me, my dad is always supportive of me but sometimes my mom sees me as this bum who’s just in his room all day, but deep down I’m itching to just go out and be a productive member to Society again, I’m just waiting for the day I’m able to get back to normal. It just sucks being in my room all the time.

Text: My depression consists of lack of interest in all of the hobbies I have, disassociation from friends and family and not caring about them, mental fog that causes me to make mistakes at work which I'm then yelled at for, fear of death and meaninglessness that takes over me, and feeling worthless and incompetent at life. 

It doesn't matter that I eat clean, exercise regularly, write my thoughts down, meditate, force myself to practice my hobbies, go to work nearly full time, take classes, keep my car and living space clean, force myself to socialize, or try to be what is generally accepted as a good person. Life is fucking miserable. 

I can't make sense of anything. If I try to make a point, an argument shuts it down. Then I question my view, change it or adapt it, then argue that point, then it gets shut down. It's as if there is no truth in the world at all and nothing is real. It's so goddamn frustrating it makes me break down. And then I think about how I'll never be like a normal person who can just be themselves and move on with their lives. I feel guilty for everything I do that I cant prove is the right thing. 

I just wan't to die all of the time and I even think about it in the middle of working or playing music, even during these intense moments where I should be focused I can only long for death and a cessation to the pain. I'm also in physical pain from multiple injuries that are long term and past drug abuse which I'm sure fucked my body up. I'm too afraid to actually kill myself because I know I'll just go into a void and my go clings onto life selfishly. I probably don't deserve to live though I make sure to tell myself I do. It doesn't help. 

I just wan't one thing to make sense in life, but everything is so confusing and I'm no good at any of it. I'll start my semesters of college with straight As, keep them till 2/3rds of the way through, then lose focus and end up with Cs or D and have to retake some classes. I'm trying to stick with my career goal of becoming a teacher but at this rate I'm still like 4 years away and I'm already 21, making minimum wage. I'm an absolute loser who nobody could love because I have no confidence. Confidence pisses me off, I just try to do what's required of me to get to where I need to be and that alone crushes me. Who could love somebody that has to fight to get themselves out of bed every morning? If I try to love myself, I just realize I'm lying about my accomplishments and I'll take it too easy on myself and not get anything done. I should be squashed like an insect for being so useless. 

I just want somebody to blow my brains out and rid the world of my incompetence and then nobody would have to worry about me. Everyone worries about how many mistakes I make, how much I fuck up, how I can't keep my shit together consistently and just keep running in circles. I'd rather just admit defeat and die. And so many people in the world probably think those like me should. 

I'm beyond saving it feels like and my brain is too fried to cling to any one thing. I just wan't everything to be true so I can stop worrying about being wrong all the time. 

I don't even make sense anymore.

Text: So I'm pretty ugly tbh, I would rate myself as a 3-4, body wise I have a nice body, starting to lose it though because I haven't worked out in a couple months, but even though I have a nice body, my face is full of acne scars and I'm going bald and I'm not even 25 yet.
Sometimes I don't even want to go outside because I feel like I'm too ugly, but that's honestly only when I'm feeling down.
The biggest problem for me is finding affection, I understand that I'm not attractive, so I don't expect the girl to be that pretty, but honestly I don't get any form of affection, and the little attention I get is from girls who are not even slightly attractive (I know talking like this, makes it seem like I'm a horrible person, but honestly idk how else to say it). 
Honestly, my mom is the only person that shows me any kind of affection, and it makes me just want to be at home all the time, even though I have friends, they are not really people who I can depend on. Sometimes I just want to start getting escorts or something to spend my time with, but I know I'll feel even more depressed if I go down that route.

Text: So I've been taking Wellbutrin and affexor I think they're both called for about a year now. They've helped alright, but I've heard that if you just stop them you can get sick. That's what the nurse at my therapy/medication office said to my therapist anyway. I have one last dose tomorrow and I don't have money to buy more even if the jackass nurse that I talked to today can figure out how to send the prescription out. What am I in for? I'm not sure when I'll be able to take them again but I'm a little nervous to be honest and I don't want to get over anxious about it and make it worse.

Text: So I (18)am in couple with my girlfriend (17) since few month. And she has a depression so I try to help her and when we are together she seems happy, so I try to always do things with her. But every times that we are not together she text me that she is sad and feel very depressed. And this time she went on vacation with her family in an other country. And it's been a week that she feels that way the problem is that when she is like this she does literally nothing else except staying in her bed. So she always text me and I call her but when I try to tell her to do stuff or motiv her she keeps getting angry and tells me that I can't understand, so she hang up and ghost me for many hours. Idk what to do cuz I really want to help her and I can't stay and do nothing when I know that my girlfriend is like that.

i’ve had depression and anxiety for over a decade but in the last 8 months, it’s the worst it’s ever been. i wake up in sheer terror every morning, cry all the time and can’t find contentment in anything i do. i’m on meds, seeing a therapist, reach out to friends and try and do the little things i’ve found meaning in before, go on walks but it’s not lifting and i’m scared i’ll be like this forever. can anyone tell me stories of how they were at their absolute worse, without hope and eventually got out of it?

Text: Hello, I've struggled with depression (diagnosed) until last year, so I'm pretty familiar with the topic and mental health in general, which is why I suggested my friend, who was having some problems at school and some angry issues, to talk about it with our school counselor. She went there twice and she's now convinced that she has depression, I didn't say anything because I don't want to invalidate her feeling but honestly I don't think so (but again, i'm not the one who should say it). First of all, she told me the counselor didn't mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesn't exhibit any signs of depression, she doesn't have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite. I feel very bad writing this, I know every depression is different, but she has no problems going through the day, and it's always the one to ask to hang out for example, while I couldn't (and sometimes still can't) get out of bed in the morning, let alone function properly. 

All of this makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, every time she talks about it with idk what to say because I can't really empathize with her. She also mentions it a lot, which makes me even more uncomfortable, like the other time she was like "oh, we are both depressed, what a great couple!" and I was like wtf, first of all I'm not depressed, and then I know it may be a way to cope with it but it sounded really bad.

Text: So a bit of background, I've struggled with mental health since a very young age. I've been in therapy several times, and have been on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds for 3 years. 

I've always thought my depression was situational, and I've worked really hard to change my life for the better. The past 6-12 months have been the best I've ever felt, as such I made the decision to start trying to come off my anti-depressants. My GP advised to take the pill on alternative nights which I've been doing for the past few weeks.

However this past week my depression has came back a lot worse, and I'm really struggling with urges to hurt myself.

I guess I'm looking for advice if anyone else has experienced this when trying to come off meds? 

Thanks for any advice offered, I'll really appreciate it.

Text: I am 20f and have been struggling with depression and PTSD since I was 13 or 14 years old. Recently I developed a severe alcohol problem that I am trying really hard to beat. Without the  old expectations of school, I find myself really unmotivated. I don't get out of bed until hours after I wake up and I have trouble finding a routine during the day. I live with my bf(23) and he is very supportive but he works a lot. On the days that he is home, we do all kinds of things together and I will even wake up early to clean or make breakfast. But when I'm alone, all that goes out the window and I don't even have the motivation to feed myself, brush my teeth, or much of anything. All I do is scroll through social media and look at everyone doing productive things with their lives. 

How do I get past this? How do I get up in the morning and do something with my life every day?

Text: I was born in September and not until a couple years ago I started feeling really depressed and sad during this time. As Soon as we hit the end of august a wave of depression comes over me and I just hate being here. I hate myself, the way I look, how I feel. Just over all disgusted with myself. And the voice in the back of my head just makes it worse Always saying things like oh another year and you’re still nothing. Living at home no boyfriend, 2 jobs still no money, youre lazy and you gained weight over quarantine you’re just pathetic and stupid” and I see other people how pretty they are and how good their life is and it gets to me. I got frustrated yesterday and almost cried because I kept getting problems wrong on my math homework (I’m in college btw). Every year now this time I just feel so worthless and it literally makes me want to end it all. I’m so over it. Does anyone know why this happens!?

Text: Trigger warning: suicide

(19F) This has been one of the lowest points of my life. I won’t go into details as to what is making me so depressed, but I realize that I really should talk about this with someone. For a while (about a week), I was actually set on committing suicide. I started planning it out in my head, was even planning out letters to write to everyone, but a part of me knew that this was the wrong decision. Even now, I’m about 50/50 on it. At this current moment my mind is more clear, so I just know that I should really tell my friends and get help before it gets to a point where I actually go through on it and start overthinking it again. 

I have 4 very close friends. We’ve been through a lot together and mental health is something we all take very seriously. While I am planning on seeing a counsellor, I just really need someone close to me to know what I’ve been going through. I’m not able to tell them in person due to covid restrictions, so it has to be either on call or through text. I just really need suggestions on to how to go about this without freaking them out and how to even initiate this conversation.

Text: I feel like such a waste of time and space again. I feel like I'm trudging through sludge and slowly getting pulled down back into the darkness of the void again. I want to stop feeling the agonizing pain of the emotional abuse I've experienced. I want to forget the things I was told from middle school. I want to be worth time and space for someone. I want to feel loved. I want to matter to someone. I want to stop feeling like this, but I feel like it might be too late now. It's been over 10 years since she told me these things. I dont think I can break the chains or heal the brands. I want this to be over. I want to finally be happy.

Text: I just realized people try their best just to avoid talking to me especially at school. I often get ignored and pushed aside from my classmates during anything. Even the teachers and staff won't give me the light of day, when i need it most. Also comparing myself to others to the point where it's an obsession. I can't stop! Some of my classmates &amp; friends have features that i desire: curves, pretty faces, &amp; lighter skin colors. (But sadly can never have without plastic surgery) They are highly praised and make me feel ugly. Multiple people on multiple occasions have told me that I'm ugly and don't want to be caught dead standing beside me. It makes me believe them even when i tried multiple times to disregard it. My self esteem and confidences just drowned within a couple of days. NEED HELP (14 almost 15 )

Text: I had a conversation with my brother recently and he was talking about how i’m going to be applying for top universities and how I could get business scholarships to help pay for it and secure a job placement if i’m one of the top performers which I could be, and how I need to consider the amount of debt i’ll be in from it when I get married, buy a house, get a car, have kids etcetera. I just... don’t feel optimistic about my prospects anymore. I don’t even care about the debt, I can’t see myself ever buying a house and I can’t even bring myself to imagine having a s/o and kid’s. All I want to do is go to bed and not move from under the covers... I don’t know when this even happened. I was at the top of my school for exams, got accepted into one of the best colleges in my country, and i’m studying hard to get good grades in my subjects as well as maintaining extracurriculars. Everything i’m doing points towards having a successful future but I don’t think I really care anymore.

Text: I have entered this on a different subreddit, but no one seems to be too responsive (besides one person who I am really thankful for). I want to hear more from others....I'm a very introverted person, and I'm smart. I know what I should do to get help, I know what the sources of my problems are, I know what I have to do. But I am so tired.

To make a long story short, I was emotionally, physically, verbally, and sexually abused for the first eleven years of my life, and now I am adopted by my godparents, who I highly respect as my mother and father.Anyways, like I said, I'm a private person. This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I don't deserve what she gives me- that I don't deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting. Of not feeling good enough for anyone.**I sometimes wish I had a normal life, but look back on it and would rather it be me than anyone else. And I want someone to see that. To not think I am vein or naive, instead looking into me. Looking at my pain, my struggles, my scars, my fighting, and be grateful. To hold me and say it was worth it, that I am strong. To let my tears fall, and look me in the eyes and say "thank you".**

Text: My (32F) boyfriend (48M) has gone through depression and anxiety a few years before we met. I met him right after he had been hospitalized for having suicidal thoughts. He’s on meds and was happy, full of energy, talkative when we first met. Now he’s in a slump again. He’s still taking his meds and has a therapist he sees occasionally, but I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do to help him or let him know I’m still here for him, and I love him. Anything I can do to help him feel better?

Text: I’m talking literally any type of treatment for my depression. Some examples:

-Tried Celexa, the following week the depression had lessened (cuz i had so much faith in this pill cuz it helped my friend) then when it was when it was supposed to start “working” (they say all antidepressants take at least a month to work) which was around the time my ‘back to normal depressed me’ depression came back. Of course they would sometimes up the dose just to see, but it never had the same impact as the first few days did.

-Tried Ashawagandha &amp; Holy basil (adaptogens) &amp; felt relief of anxiety for a few days, then back to same old GAD self (cuz i have faith in natural remedies)

-Tried yoga &amp; exercise, but hard to keep up with when i’m too depressed &amp; anxious (&amp; it’s freezing out) to leave the house . i’d workout more in my house if the ceilings weren’t so low &amp; i had more privacy (i hate being watched, yes even if someone’s in the other room doing their own thing &amp; not even looking at me) 

-Tried eating more healthy (not saying i eat unhealthy), felt good for like a meal then nothing, but i’m such a picky eater it’s hard to always eat ‘the right stuff’ 

-Tried Positive affirmations, about 1/15 times it can give a little relief, but nothing that a deep breath couldn’t do

-Tried deep breathing, helpful to slow down breathing when anxious but extremely hard to remember to do

-Tried (&amp; still trying) therapy, but i’ve had multiple therapists &amp; after a bit it just turns into a chore/exhausting to continuously bring up like “yep, today i get to bring up my depression again &amp; remind myself of all the bad stuff yet again”.

idk i’m feeling quite hopeless.
and the most frustrating part is that since i’m literally thinking my way into something working, like why can’t i just do it myself? or like why doesn’t it stay? i really don’t understand ..

Text: A few months ago, I tried to talk to new people at my school. Every time I did, however, I felt drained and unsatisfied with the conversation. This later progressed into actively avoiding social situations with people I didn't know. I don't have many friends in the first place and I have hopes of finding a romantic relationship with a girl, but now I absolutely hate talking to people I don't know. Maybe I didn't talk to the right people, but I feel like it's something more. I don't get very anxious in social situations, so I don't think it could be social anxiety. I would like some tips on how to socialize with new people, or maybe a reason why I desperately don't want to talk to unknown people.

I posted my story on another sub for some support. Feel free to read it…it’s long. I am just feeling very depressed today. "Depressed" being an understatement. She was my world. We were going to get married and have a life together. Had our kids name picked out. She told me she couldn’t imagine her life without me. Now she’s posting pictures with the guy she cheated on me and left me for saying how amazing he is. He’s a loser, no job, no education, can’t support her. I would have given her the world. 

She doesn’t love me. She’ll never come back to me. What’s the point anymore? I don’t care about having a good job or having “a lot going for me”. The one thing I want in life I can’t have. Her. She was my everything. I don’t want someone else. I literally don’t care about anything in my life anymore. I hate everything. I hate myself. I lost her. I treated her so well but it just wasn’t enough. And now she’s gone. I don’t know what to do. I just wake up, go to work, go to the gym, go to bed and repeat. Every day is the same and my partner is now happy with someone else. What am I supposed to do? I feel broken. Thanks in advance.

Text: Every time I’m on my period my depression gets worse. I can’t bring myself to do anything and my tears won’t stop falling. I feel sad over the smallest things and get super exhausted. 

I think it’s time to end my life. Like the urge becomes strong and then I start thinking of ways and then I fall asleep. I don’t want to go on like this forever. Life is the worst fucking thing to have happened to me and I want nothing to do with it. 

I’m actually the weakest person I’ve met. And I just realized that it gets worse during my period.

Text: Hello everyone, 

This is my first time on reddit and my first time posting. I am sure many people face issues that are much worse than mine, but I don't know what to do anymore other than ask for help. English is not my first language so I apologise for any mistakes. 

For context: I am 24 yo, female,  with a stable job and a loving boyfriend. By all means I should be happy right? Well I started feeling more and more depressed a few months ago and so far, it hasn't changed. I don't feel like eating and have lost weight, I don't feel like going out or hanging out with people and I could literally spend my whole day sleeping (which I did for the past two days, missing work), I often find myself crying for no reason and I don't enjoy anything anymore. 

My boyfriend is abroad for a while because of his studies, and so I am able to hide from him most of the time. But it's getting harder and harder and I think he is starting to lose patience. Our last two conversations was him telling me that he is sick of me moaning every two days and crying for no reason.

This is not the first time I have been depressed, and usually it follows something bad, but this time I feel like it's all in my head  and it's Something that I can't get out of. It's starting to impact my job, my Relationship and everything else in my life...Do any of you have any advice for me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to read this post!

Text: It's like everyone around me has accomplished something amazing and life-changing, and all I've ever done was self-harm and cry. My bipolar Dad doesn't believe/care that I'm depressed and is constantly lecturing me about not reading enough. I want to be myself again, I just want to love the things I used to love. Is that too much to ask? 

I also feel as if every day I'm losing a piece of myself and it's causing me drastic emotional instability, I'm going to snap one day if I don't get help whether I like it or not. This is the only place I can vent without annoying my loved ones. All of my friends are sick of me, it's gotten to the point where even my depressed friend thinks I'm too much and no longer wants to talk to me. 

I can barely control any of my emotions anymore, it's like I'm watching my life instead of living it. I laugh at horrible tragic things that aren't funny because of it, which has caused me a lot of backlash in the long run. I want to feel normal, and just live my life without having to worry about random mental breakdowns throughout the day.

I'm sorry this dragged on for so long I guess I kinda went overboard as per usual...

Text: I am having suicidal thoughts, and I try all sorts of things to make those thoughts go away. I haven't had professional help yet (not much money in my pocket right now). This led me to wonder whether depression is curable (in plain words: does it really end?).

Do the sad thoughts just go away? 
- If not then, how do you deal with it differently (now)? 
- If yes, then what steps did you take to reach this point?

Text: On Facebook,

This person began to message me. I do not know who they are in person. They began telling me about how they hate their life. I tried to be empathetic. Then, they began to inform me the date they are going to kill their self. I tried hard to inform this person how people will miss them and that they have a reason to live for their god children. They refused and still told me they are going to do it. 

What do I do next, I do not feel safe with this. I feel this person will do it and I don't know what to do. If I report the chat to Facebook, they will find out and not speak to me anymore. What do I do?

Text: I feel like I am trapped and powerless. I am a graduate student and my studies are going down the drain. My teacher just told me that I don't have a big chance of passing a huge course and that I have only one week to do everything. I am already stuck doing another course and that isn't going well too. And I deserve it too cause I have no affinity towards my subject. On top of this I already suffer from depression and I'm just sick of the sleepless nights or crying myself to sleep. I just don't wanna exist anymore. I don't want to be a worthless sack of shit and just keep failing over and over. I just want it to be over. I wish I had the guts to take my life and just be done with it.

Text: Me and my husband have been together for 10 years and have two small children together. The past year has been intense and lately my husband is on the brink of a breakdown.
It's tough on me and the kids as well, I'm tired. I've thought about giving him space from me and parenting, but I'm not sure of it will help him or drive him even further because it might feel like a let down. .
What do you think? I know it's complex, and a lot of details are missing, but if you tried to generalize the case?

Thanks.

Text: We’ve only been dating 5 months but we lived together for 4 because of the pandemic. Recently I came back to live in my house and discussed that we would see each other a few times a week. 

She changed a lot after I left, she went to see a lot of friends and only saw her once. She started therapy sessions and told me she feels really unhappy. 

As someone who struggled with depression myself I understand which is why I’m so conflicted. I want to be there for her but I don’t know if she wants me to. I don’t want to smother her but I want her to know she has my full support and I’m here for her for anything she needs. I was debating whether to ask her if she wants me to come live with her again but she was the one that suggested to stay in our own places again because it would be better for our relationship. 

I’m just terrified of her breaking up with me because she wants to sort herself out. It would break me. Should I ask her if she wants me to go back? Should I take initiative with things or let her tell me when and what she wants? I just want her to feel loved and supported but I also know she’s very independent and doesn’t like asking for things.

Text: When I was a kid, up until 2nd grade I went to a private school and I was at the top of my grade up until 3rd grade where I missed most of the year due to traveling. I ended up in a charter school, and ever since then, I lost most of my social skills and I started to get failing grades. My grades got so bad, in fourth grade I had all F’s. The thing is, my parents never held me back even though I needed to be, because I would’ve seemed like an embarrassment. I kept trying my best, and up until high school rn, I’m still struggling and failing classes. Here’s the twist though, I always got the highest air test scores in my grade. Idk what to do or if I’m stupid or what. I want to go to college and make my parents proud, but I feel too dumb. What am I supposed to do...

Text: I've hit fucking rock bottom. I'm rn a college student pursuing CS which I took because I'm fucking dumb and thought it would pay well. It probably does but I'm miserable rn.I have no interest in doing it anymore. (Not in america,europe so cant change majors easily) This mixed with the fact that I'm horribly depressive in a country where even the already shit treatment for mental health is even worse. I was on SSRI's but went off of them myself cos my doctor would just not listen to my complanits about its side effects. 
I'm only posting this cos I feel heavily (you know the word). Feel like I'm really close to the point of no return 
So any words to the contrary would be helpful

Text: I've been going through a really bad depression and I've had alot of trouble sleeping because of it or I at least think that's the reason I honestly have no idea at this point. I've had alot of stress lately family drama, money problems and more you know normal stuff. I also have alot of trauma from the past that I need to eventually get off my chest but that's for another night. I do plan on seeing a doctor and getting help when I can afford it but right now I need help sleeping. I'm exhausted but have so much trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I'm so desperate for a good night of sleep. Does anyone have any tips?

Text: Hi,
This is a throwaway account.
I need some help and/or advice.

About a half a year ago I (32F) started dating someone (M42) absolutely amazing. 
We share interest, same humor, honesty have been there since the beginning, we can talk about anything, even shared deeply vulnerable stories and the sex is amazing as well. We seem to be able to connect in a way I've never tried before and create this space where it is just us. Green flags all the way. 
I quickly fell madly in love with him ofcourse. I shared my feelings for him about 4 months into it, told him no pressure at all since I wasnt ready for a full blown serious relationship and he didnt either. I have no doubt that he has feelings for me. Non. 

About 2 months ago he fell deep down into depression. He told me. I told him if there was anything I could do to help? He said maybe. I told him I was there if he needed to talk. He said thank you. 
Asked him if he wanted to meet up again soon? He said he was feeling so bad and was overwhelmed at work (he works a lot). I said no problem, you just write me when the time is better, no pressure and I'm not mad. Take your time. He said he would. 

Its been a month since that last text, and I haven't heard anything. My guts tell me to just wait, but I am worried and a little unsure of how to handle this situation.. Should I keep on waiting (I am not in a hurry and if I'm not going to continue my relationship with him I dont feel like dating at all right now) or should I reach out? (afraid of preassuring). 

Abandoning him is not an option. 

Please give me some advice or share if you have a similare story. I would love to hear from someone who has depression and who is dating someone who hasnt.

Text: Does anyone feel like they hate working... I hate the concept of money too.. Having to just spend all your time working to feed yourself.. I Just hate this system we created.. It makes me want to not exist...Why the hell do we have to spend our lives like this? Why the hell do we have to work? The stress is literally killing me

I feel so sad and exhausted to have to do this every single fucking day... I hope no one tells me about finding your purpose or what job makes me happy kinda shit. Thing is, I hate capitalism. I have a decent job and i'm good at it. It's actually a better job and salary than most people get around here. But having to spend my life everyday just working is just fucking depressing and I wanna die....

Text: I'm only 19. I understand that if I get through this there will be so much life to be had, but things are starting to look bleak. My best friend/girlfriend is dying. She has Ehlos Danlers Syndrome, arrhythmia, and those are both being made worse by the fact that she's developed anorexia nervosa. She's withering away and it's killing me. I haven't gotten out of bed for anything other than work for a half a week. I've been severely depressed my entire life, but this is the first time that I've wanted to kill myself. Not that I want to not exist, but I fully want to kill myself. I need help.

Text: Okay, so I know that alcohol is a depressant and that it usually doesn't mix well when you're already depressed, but I wouldn't think a response to it would ever be consistently this bad. 

Long story short, went out for a few drinks with some work friends to celebrate my last day and the new job that I got. It was fun, these are people I like, and things were starting to get a bit better for me. Took 173 applications but I finally got a salaried gig, finally established a group of friends for myself after moving to a new city in a pandemic, found an advisor for my master's thesis. But at a certain point, maybe one or two beers past where I should have stopped, I just wasn't there. I left, didn't say goodbye to anyone, attempted to bike home, and cried on the side of the road after falling off my bike.   


I'm usually a little bit of an emotional drunk, but I mostly just get affectionate and want to make sure my friends know that I love them. It's never been this, I've never felt this outside of my own experience. Thoughts?

Text: I(26m) have been struggling with depression since I started university. I got my MA in poli sci in 2019 and my mental health took a downward turn for the worse since. I’ve just been unemployed and struggling with suicidal thoughts since then.

I feel like this in large part because all the careers I truly want to get into are basically too competitive for me to get into. I would specially like to be a high school teacher, physician, police officer or work in the civil service but I live in Ontario and all those jobs are way too competitive to get into.

I haven’t really tried because I don’t think I’ll even get an interview. It sucks because I need to get a decent job to move forward in life but I don’t want to keep living if I’ll never get a career I actually want.

I’m changing anti-depressants and seeing a really good therapist but I don’t think I can change anymore.

I suffered so much in and after university just to be little further ahead. 

What should I do? I feel like I’ll never be able to get over this.

Text: I’m 16F btw. For many many years I’ve been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think “oh I don’t look too bad” and sometimes I think “oh god I can’t go out I’m so ugly”. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? I’m not sure because I can’t self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 1-2 times a day and limiting my calories. And I’m not sure if that’s extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. I’m scared to go to the extreme and go underweight (I’m close to being it) because I have a deadly disease and could die if I’m not eating properly. And I’m not too educated on ED’s so I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic. Back to my “depression”, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they don’t want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that I’m ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe I’m all those things they’ve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best I’ve ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I don’t exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasn’t good enough, or I was too ugly that she didn’t want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that I’m so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group I’m really close with is that we have “therapy” sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. I’ve yet to have my “session” yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I can’t say cause I haven’t been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... That’s probably because I haven’t told them all this, and I would’ve but I’m afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what I’m feeling isn’t serious and they think bad of me. And I’m scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine I’m floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and I’ve always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I don’t think I would because it’s a sin in my religion, but maybe one day I’m too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, I’ve made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares. Thank you.

Text: I’m so depressed to the point where I just feel empty. I don’t do anything any more. Just sit in my room mainly. I have exams currently and I can’t study for more than 20 minutes without taking a 4 hour break. Any task that I need to do is dwelled over for hours on end before actually being done. I don’t have any courage, any willpower, any energy whatsoever. I feel lost and don’t know how I can stop being like this. There’s so much other stuff wrong with me I haven’t said here. I’ve also thought about suicide quite a bit. Doubt I’d actually follow through with it, but the thoughts are there.

Text: This is probably the most embarrassing post I’ve ever made, but I need help. I’ve been working my way through a depressive episode for the past couple months, and I thought I was doing fairly good with it, since I’ve been showering fairly often (at least every other day) and eating at least once a day, but recently one of my friends messaged me privately to ask if I was okay, because the last few times he saw me, he said he smelled a “strong body odor” and it was making him not want to be around me. I immediately went and bought some men’s deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this. Honestly I’m just upset that I let it get bad enough for people to notice, and I keep wondering how many people have been choosing to just say nothing and deal with it. Any help that y’all can give me would be great; thank you so much for your time!

Text: i'm 22. i've had extreme depression (and anxiety) for years, got diagnosed, prescribed meds (xanax, citalopram) but all in all i'm really, really not doing well.

this is going to sound so lazy and gross, but all i do is sit around and play games. i don't do chores anymore, my house is disgusting. i haven't showered in literally a year. i'm not joking. yes, i clean my private parts but i literally haven't been in a shower for around a year.

i've let my muscles deteriorate so much that i get winded going to the bathroom. i've become a disgusting pile of nothing of a human being, and i don't know how to change, or how to get the motivation to change. every time i decide on doing something to better myself, i give up again.

i don't know what to do anymore. what should i do?

Text: tl;dr: My partner has been depressed and not knowing what to do with his life for a long time. I am the only person he relys on for support and I can't bear it any longer. It starts to severely affect my own life quality and happiness.

I (30/f) met my partner (32/m) at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelor's thesis. That didn't happen for another four years.   
Within that time he basically didn't do anything. Didn't write his thesis, didn't get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses (always did and still do), so money wouldn't be the problem. He never did any internship. 

Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelor's and started a master's degree but realized that studying just isn't for him. However he still isn't properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doens't know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. He's not. He's incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isn't enough for any job and he doens't dare to apply. I don't know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that I'm the only one he's talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. 

So here is the thing. I know he's depressed and I know that he is busy with surviving day to day. But I'm pissed. I sometimes get so angry and frustrated with him. He doesn't go to therapy and I don't know, if he really tried to get a therapist but the waiting lists are too long or if he didn't try hard enough. He won't tell me. Same thing with his job situation. I don't know, if he is searching and for what. Everytime I ask him, what he wants to be or do he tells me, he doesn't know. And I started asking him really deconstructed questions like "what kind of activities (writing texts/organizing events/making statistic sheets/etc) do you like?" "do you want to work alone or in a team?" "what goals (helping people and what kind of people/income/etc) do you want to be met?" and so on. It's always "I don't know."

I am getting really impatient. It's been six years and he has so much potential that he doesn't see or use. Everytime I suggest something, he doesn't use that info, but feels stupid, becaus he didn't have the idea himself. Doesn't matter that I keep reassuring him that it is okay, to need help or not know everything on the spot. He feels stupid and blocks any further conversation and than i find myself trying to calm him down and in the end he promises me to change things, but never does. Probably because he really doesn't have the energy, I get that on an intellectual level. I understand it. I still feel extremely frustrated.

This whole situation keeps our life on hold. It didn't matter to me for a long time. I always told myself, that he will find his way and that he will figure everything out, but now we are in our thirties and I really want to start a family. I want to get married and have children and start the next chapter. I can't do that with a man who barely survives. And it starts to severely affect me. I get so impatient with him and sometimes I find myself blaming him and I know, that is a terrible thing to do to a depressed person and that i should be patient and understanding. But I'm carrying this alone, because he doesn't talk to anyone else about his struggles. 

The worst part is, that he has been away for two weeks to look after his parents' house while they were on vacation and I have felt so good! So so good! So free. I started singing again while doing chores and had a dance party with myself and there were a lot of those little signs of being happy again. He's back home now and I feel like I'm suffocating. I didn't realize it at first, because we're always together. But I feel like I can't be happy, because he isn't. I feel like I can't rejoice over my little victories because he has none. I want to talk about my masters and my ideas for work and all the new input I'm getting (I am studying for a master's degree btw), but I feel guilty, because he isn't passionate about anything. I feel like i can't live my life because I know, that everything I do reminds him of all the things, he doesn't (earning money, socialize, building a future, personal growth).

I really do love him and I don't want to break up or anything. But I also don't know, how I should move on and how we can survive as a couple any longer. I need to breathe but I can't.

Text: This is too hard. I can come out of these deep depressive states but over the years the length of time I’m out of them just continually get smaller and the length of time I’m in them is longer and darker. This time I was out for 2 days. I’ve just completely dived back in. I can’t see any light when I’m like this. I can’t eat I can’t sleep I can’t get out of bed I only think about killing myself. I live alone and it’s very common for me to not reply to my friends and family, I don’t think people would notice for days. I tried anti depressants for the first time, which was a big step for me. SSRI. I became more suicidal but they also knocked me out for about a week. I came off them and felt great for two days bc I had energy. Then felt the dark cloud coming back and tried to work with my psych to help myself not get drenched again, maybe just a light shower and get back up. But now I’ve suffered a big emotional blow in one of my relationships - and I’m just not equipped to handle such a thing right now. I can only talk to my psych and my friend about it. My friend hasn’t responded and I haven’t got a psych appointment for 3 weeks. Usually knowing I’ll see her weekly helps me get through the hard days

Text: It honestly feels like there's nothing you can do. I've pushed all my friends away and I no longer enjoy anything I used to. I don't tell my family anything that's going on because they don't understand or care about my mental health. I just feel extremely lost and powerless. I don't have a lot of money so I can't afford medication or therapy, even though I believe therapy won't help me anyway due to past experiences. Is there anything I can do? Or do I just have to rot away until the loneliness kills me

She's like "i've just accepted that everything's bad and it's gonna say that way"

and im like " no things can get better, nothing's set in stone. but no one's gonna change it for you. You need to do it yourself."

and she's like "i dont care enough about it to change it."

&amp;#x200B;

That's basically it. No matter how shit things are she doesnt care enough to try and improve them. idk how to help.

Text: I don't know what to do and it's too early for me to be crying. But my ex (who I still love and care for so much) just messaged me this morning asking to hang out because he's moving and we might not see each other again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background of the story: we broke up maybe 2 weeks ago and he's been battling depression, hence why I am here to learn more and help him about his situations. Never thought I would be the one actually seeking help here for myself. (I can't really think of anything else right now, I'm too sad about it).

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know, but I feel so down and broken right now. I just need someone to talk to about this and I don't know what else..

Text: Everyday I wake up with an unsettling feeling in my stomach, it's such a challenge for me to get out of bed and get to school. I used to have a drive to do amazingly academically and become someone I've always dreamed of.. But now I don't see the point. 

Every lunch time I just sit in the bathroom stall, each day feels so painfully long. I hate it. Most of my friends have betrayed me, so I don't enjoy hanging out with anyone at school.

I don't want to talk to my school counseller about my problems, I have a fear of being judged by someone who doesn't know me, and I feel like my reasoning for skipping school is so invalid. My mum is so angry and thinks I'm playing a game with her. She keeps telling me "there's not long to go just keep pushing yourself", and I realise that but it's still so hard for me to get up every morning.

Text: She’s 59 and has chronic asthma. Her oxygen is at 94%, her doctor told her if it gets down to 90% she needs to go to the hospital. 

But most of the hospitals around me are at 100% capacity! I am terrified and my anxiety is out of control. Every second, I feel I am closer to a panic attack. 

But I’m trying to remain calm and not show her how scared I am.

Please. I just need words of love, support and encouragement.

If you pray, please pray for my family. If you don’t, please think positive healing thoughts.

Text: I was seeing one who was great for the first 3 years and then started really pushing CBT and mindfulness onto me, despite me saying multiple times I hate both of those approaches and they don't work for me.

I havent seen anyone since December and I think I need to. I'm going downhill again. How do I bring it up that I'm not doing CBT, mindfulness and 'homework' sheets.

My GP offered to write a letter to my old psychologist explaining all that, but my anxiety is too high to go back and be questioned about it.

I hate all of this. So much.

my grandpa is dying and it hurts me to know in a few years ill look back on my life at this time and hate the way i handled things. i will hate myself in the last few months with my grandpa. i want to stop this. it makes my depression worse and its so annoying

Text: I don't quite know if I should fully go into every detail or not. But here goes.

I'm so unbelievably inconfident and depressed that nothing, nothing gets through to me. Not a single compliment, not a single word of positivity gets through into my mind. And I feel so utterly lost, I keep losing friends and I keep having to get dumped by my partners. I've frankly had enough of this nightmare and I wish I could just escape. I tried repeating a positive affirmation to myself, for a month, hundreds of times a day, but nothing changed. I tried being more productive, and I still am, but it's still just complete and utter misery. What am I supposed to do? I've got no therapist to help me for another 2 months or so, and I doubt they'll be able to help, not a single therapist in my life has. I feel drained, empty and worthless, if I wasn't scared or fearful, I'd be dead. I do feel highly suicidal, but I'm too weak of a person to actually go through with it. Please, this is the last cry of help I can give with the energy I have left..I need something, one last try. This is my very first post, and this place was my only last resort.

Text: I'm in a funk. No real reason why. Nothing has set me in a downward spiral. In fact, I should be super happy since we just bought a new house that I love. I AM happy about it. I love my house.

But here I am again having no energy for personal relationships, fighting the urge to end all of my friendships because I just don't want them. It's not urges to just end the friendships, but destroy friendships, burn all bridges. My work was being affected and I took a day off on Tuesday just because I didn't want to be there. I have never taken a day off for no reason. 

I am sure this will pass and I'll be fine again. But what do I do in the meantime?  What do I say when people ask if everything is ok?  Or when they say something is up with me?  There is literally nothing for me to be upset about right now. I am afraid I am going to come off whiny or just self pitying.

I don’t know if it is depression yet but i always feel sad and cry myself to sleep. I just feel emotional and phase out all the time, i am trying to remain positive all day long but when i get home i just pass out crying on the kitchen floor every day and i don’t even know why i just feel sad. I have lost all sexual interrest and i havent done anything relates to that because i just didn’t feel like doing  it. I force myself to eat every single. Is this depression or something else i assume it is but even though if it isn’t what can i do to feel better i am losing motivation and be sadder every day i dont want to pass out crying anymore i just feel like a piece of shit that cant accomplice anything
